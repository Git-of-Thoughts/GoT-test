    Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

    I'm Shangdian (King) Han.

    At Microsoft Research, I prototyped the new Office AI for Excel.

    I believe high-quality code generation AI will be
    the most important development for human civilization in the near future,
    for the simple reason that code shapes our world today.

    That's why I'm building an LLM agent customization platform to
    enhance the SOTA in code generation AI.
