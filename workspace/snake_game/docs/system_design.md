## Implementation approach
We will use Pygame, an open-source Python library designed for making video games, to create our snake game. Pygame provides us with the necessary tools to create a game window, draw objects, handle user input, and more. We will create a Game class to handle the game logic, a Snake class to represent the player-controlled snake, and a Food class to represent the food the snake eats. The game will increase in difficulty by speeding up the snake each time it eats food. We will also implement a simple GUI to display the current score and high score, and to allow the user to start, pause, and resume the game.

## Python package name
```python
"snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "gui.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game{
        +int score
        +int high_score
        +bool game_over
        +bool paused
        +Snake snake
        +Food food
        +start_game()
        +pause_game()
        +resume_game()
        +end_game()
        +update()
    }
    class Snake{
        +list body
        +int speed
        +str direction
        +move()
        +grow()
    }
    class Food{
        +tuple position
        +respawn()
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: eats
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    M->>G: create game
    G->>S: create snake
    G->>F: create food
    M->>G: start game
    loop Game Loop
        G->>S: move snake
        G->>F: check if snake eats food
        G->>S: grow snake if food eaten
        G->>F: respawn food if eaten
        G->>M: update score and high score
    end
    opt Pause Game
        M->>G: pause game
        M->>G: resume game
    end
    G->>M: end game
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
