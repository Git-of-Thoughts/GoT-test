## Implementation approach
We will be using the Pygame library, an open-source module for Python, to create the snake game. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games which provides functionalities such as drawing on the screen, handling keyboard and mouse events, playing sounds, and more. The game will have a Game class which will handle the game logic, a Snake class which will handle the snake's movement and growth, and a Food class to handle the placement of food in the game. The game's difficulty level can be adjusted by increasing the speed of the snake.

## Python package name
```python
"snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "constants.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game{
        -int score
        -int high_score
        -Snake snake
        -Food food
        +__init__(self)
        +run(self)
        +reset(self)
        +update_score(self)
        +draw(self)
    }
    class Snake{
        -list body
        -str direction
        +__init__(self)
        +move(self)
        +grow(self)
        +draw(self)
    }
    class Food{
        -tuple position
        +__init__(self)
        +reposition(self)
        +draw(self)
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: has
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    M->>G: create game
    G->>S: create snake
    G->>F: create food
    loop game loop
        G->>G: run
        G->>S: move snake
        alt if snake eats food
            G->>S: grow snake
            G->>F: reposition food
            G->>G: update score
        end
        G->>G: draw
        alt if game over
            G->>G: reset
        end
    end
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
