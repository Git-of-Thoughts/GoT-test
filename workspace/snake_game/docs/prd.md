## Original Requirements
The boss has tasked me with designing the software of a fun snake game in Python. The code for the game should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a fun and engaging snake game in Python",
    "Ensure the game is easy to understand and play",
    "Optimize the game for performance and efficiency"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily start a new game so that I can play whenever I want",
    "As a user, I want the game to be challenging so that I can improve my skills",
    "As a user, I want the game to run smoothly without any lags or glitches",
    "As a user, I want to be able to pause and resume the game so that I can take breaks",
    "As a user, I want to see my high score so that I can track my progress"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Python Snake Game: A simple, text-based snake game. It lacks advanced features and graphical interface",
    "Pygame Snake: A more advanced snake game made with Pygame. It has a graphical interface but lacks features like pausing the game or tracking high scores",
    "Slither.io: An online multiplayer snake game. It has many features but may be too complex for users looking for a simple snake game",
    "Google Snake Game: A simple and well-designed snake game. It lacks some features like pausing the game",
    "Nokia Snake Game: The classic snake game from Nokia phones. It's very simple and lacks modern features"
]
```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a simple, fun, and engaging snake game written in Python. It should include features like starting a new game, pausing and resuming the game, and tracking high scores. The game should be easy to understand and play, and should run smoothly without any lags or glitches.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement the basic functionality of the snake game", "P0"),
    ("Add a feature to start a new game", "P0"),
    ("Add a feature to pause and resume the game", "P1"),
    ("Add a feature to track high scores", "P1"),
    ("Optimize the game for performance and efficiency", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The game will have a simple and clean user interface. The game screen will display the snake and the food. The score will be displayed at the top of the screen. There will be buttons for starting a new game and pausing/resuming the game. The game will have a classic, retro style with a monochrome color scheme.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
