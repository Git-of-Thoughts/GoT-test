```python
[
    ("Develop the basic game mechanics including snake movement and growth", "P0"),
    ("Implement a scoring system to track user's high scores", "P0"),
    ("Design an intuitive user interface for the game", "P0"),

## UI Design draft
The game will have a simple and clean interface. The main screen will display the game area where the snake moves. The snake will be controlled using the arrow keys. The current score will be displayed at the top of the screen. There will be a pause button at the bottom of the screen. The game will have a retro design aesthetic with bright colors to make it visually appealing.
