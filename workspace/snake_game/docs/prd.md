## Original Requirements
The boss has tasked us with designing the software for a fun snake game in Python. The code for the game should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a fun, engaging snake game",
    "Ensure the game is easy to understand and play",
    "Design the game to be visually appealing"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily understand the game rules so I can start playing quickly",
    "As a user, I want the game to be challenging so I can improve my skills",
    "As a user, I want to be able to see my high score so I can track my progress",
    "As a user, I want the game to be visually appealing so I can enjoy playing it",
    "As a user, I want the game to run smoothly without any glitches"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Python Snake Game: Simple graphics, easy to understand, lacks variety in gameplay",
    "Slither.io: Multiplayer, more complex, visually appealing",
    "Snake '97: Classic design, nostalgic, simple gameplay",
    "Snake VS Block: Adds a new twist to the classic game, visually appealing",
    "Happy Snake: Simple design, easy to play, lacks challenging elements"
