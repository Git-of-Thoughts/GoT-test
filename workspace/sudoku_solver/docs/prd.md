## Original Requirements
The boss has tasked us with designing a software product that includes a Sudoku solver written in JavaScript. The Sudoku solver should be able to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a Sudoku solver that can solve any valid Sudoku puzzle",
    "Ensure the solver is efficient and fast",
    "Make the product user-friendly and easy to use"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to input my Sudoku puzzle and get the solution",
    "As a user, I want the solver to be fast so I don't have to wait long for the solution",
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily understand how to use the solver",
    "As a user, I want the solver to tell me if my puzzle is invalid",
    "As a user, I want the solver to show me the steps it took to solve the puzzle"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Sudoku.com: Offers a Sudoku solver but it's slow and doesn't provide step-by-step solutions",
    "SudokuSolver.net: Provides a fast solver but the user interface is not user-friendly",
    "Sudoku-solutions.com: Offers a solver with step-by-step solutions but it's not efficient for large puzzles",
    "Sudoku9x9.com: Provides a solver with a user-friendly interface but it's not efficient",
    "SudokuSolver.org: Offers a solver that's efficient but doesn't provide step-by-step solutions"
]
```

    "Our Target Product": [0.9, 0.9]
```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a Sudoku solver that can solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. It should be efficient and fast, and also user-friendly. The solver should provide feedback if the puzzle is invalid and show the steps it took to solve the puzzle.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Sudoku solver that can solve any valid puzzle", "P0"),
    ("Efficient and fast solver", "P0"),
    ("User-friendly interface", "P0"),
    ("Feedback for invalid puzzles", "P1"),
    ("Display of solution steps", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The user interface should be clean and simple. It should have an input area where users can enter their Sudoku puzzle. There should be a 'Solve' button to start the solving process. If the puzzle is invalid, an error message should be displayed. Once the puzzle is solved, the solution should be displayed in a new area, with an option to view the solution steps.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
