## Implementation approach
We will use Python as our main programming language due to its simplicity and wide range of libraries. For the CUDA implementation, we will use PyCUDA, an open-source Python wrapper for CUDA programming. The game logic will be implemented using standard Python libraries. The user interface will be created using Tkinter, a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. The software will use a minimax algorithm to solve the game in the least amount of moves possible. The difficult point in the requirement is the CUDA implementation, but PyCUDA provides a Pythonic interface to CUDA which simplifies the process.

## Python package name
```python
"cuda_tictactoe_solver"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game_logic.py",
    "solver.py",
    "gui.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game{
        +str board[3][3]
        +bool game_over
        +str winner
        +__init__()
        +reset_game()
        +check_game_over()
    }
    class Solver{
        +Game game
        +__init__(game: Game)
        +minimax(board: list, depth: int, isMaximizing: bool): int
        +find_best_move(board: list): tuple
    }
    class GUI{
        +Game game
        +Solver solver
        +__init__(game: Game, solver: Solver)
        +draw_board()
        +update_board()
        +reset_board()
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Solver: has
    Game "1" -- "1" GUI: has
    Solver "1" -- "1" GUI: has
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Solver
    participant GUI as GUI
    M->>G: create game
    G-->>M: game created
    M->>S: create solver with game
    S-->>M: solver created
    M->>GUI: create GUI with game and solver
    GUI-->>M: GUI created
    GUI->>G: reset game
    G-->>GUI: game reset
    GUI->>S: find best move
    S-->>GUI: best move found
    GUI->>G: update board with best move
    G-->>GUI: board updated
    GUI->>G: check game over
    G-->>GUI: game over status
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
