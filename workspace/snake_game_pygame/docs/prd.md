## Original Requirements
The boss has instructed to design the software of a fun snake game in Python. The code for the game should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a fun and engaging snake game",
    "Ensure the game is easy to understand and play",
    "Ensure the game is coded efficiently in Python"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to easily start a new game so I can play whenever I want",
    "As a user, I want the game to be challenging so that I can improve my skills",
    "As a user, I want to be able to pause and resume the game so I can take breaks",
    "As a user, I want to see my high score so I can track my progress",
    "As a user, I want the game to run smoothly without any lag"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Python Snake Game by XYZ: Simple design, lacks advanced features",
    "Python Snake Game by ABC: Offers multiple difficulty levels, but has performance issues",
    "Python Snake Game by DEF: Has a variety of game modes, but the interface is not user-friendly",
    "Python Snake Game by GHI: Has a modern design, but the game is not challenging enough",
    "Python Snake Game by JKL: Offers online multiplayer, but the game is too complex for beginners"
