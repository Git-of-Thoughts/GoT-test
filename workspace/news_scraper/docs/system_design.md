## Implementation approach
The system will be implemented as a Python script that uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping and smtplib for sending emails. The script will be scheduled to run at regular intervals using the schedule library. The script will first scrape the latest technology news from the donews platform, then send the news to the specified email address. If any errors or exceptions occur during the process, they will be logged using the logging library and the user will be notified.

## Python package name
```python
"news_scraper"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "scraper.py",
    "emailer.py",
    "scheduler.py",
    "logger.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Scraper{
        +str url
        +list news
        +__init__(url: str)
        +scrape(): list
    }
    class Emailer{
        +str recipient
        +str sender
        +str password
        +__init__(recipient: str, sender: str, password: str)
        +send(news: list)
    }
    class Scheduler{
        +str interval
        +__init__(interval: str)
        +schedule(task: function)
    }
    class Logger{
        +str filename
        +__init__(filename: str)
        +log(message: str)
    }
    Scraper "1" --> "1" Emailer: sends news to
    Emailer "1" --> "1" Logger: logs errors to
    Scheduler "1" --> "1" Scraper: schedules
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant S as Scraper
    participant E as Emailer
    participant Sch as Scheduler
    participant L as Logger
    M->>S: create Scraper
    M->>E: create Emailer
    M->>L: create Logger
    M->>Sch: create Scheduler
    Sch->>S: schedule scrape
    S->>E: send news
    E->>L: log errors
    Sch->>M: end program
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
