## Original Requirements
The boss requires a system that can extract the latest technology news from the donews platform and send it to the email address cqtxh@163.com. The system should be developed in the role of an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Develop a system that can efficiently extract the latest technology news from the donews platform",
    "Ensure the system can automatically send the extracted news to the specified email address",
    "Ensure the system is reliable and can handle potential errors or exceptions"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As an engineer, I want to develop a system that can automatically extract the latest technology news from the donews platform",
    "As an engineer, I want the system to send the extracted news to the specified email address automatically",
    "As a user, I want to receive the latest technology news in my email without manually checking the donews platform",
    "As a user, I want the system to be reliable and not miss any important news updates",
    "As a user, I want the system to handle potential errors or exceptions and notify me if there are any issues"
]
```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a system that can automatically extract the latest technology news from the donews platform and send it to a specified email address. The system should be reliable and able to handle potential errors or exceptions.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Develop a news extraction module that can pull the latest technology news from the donews platform", "P0"),
    ("Develop an email module that can send the extracted news to the specified email address", "P0"),
    ("Ensure the system can handle potential errors or exceptions", "P0"),
    ("Develop a scheduling module that can automate the news extraction and email sending process", "P1"),
    ("Develop a notification system that can alert the user if there are any issues", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The system will be a command-line based application. The main interface will display the status of the system, including the last extraction time, the number of news items extracted, and the last email sent time. The system will also display any errors or exceptions that occur during the extraction or email sending process.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
