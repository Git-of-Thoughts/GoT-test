## Implementation approach
We will use Pygame, an open-source library designed for making video games in Python. Pygame is a good choice because it provides functionalities for creating graphical user interfaces and handling events, which are necessary for our game. The difficult points of the requirements are the implementation of the game mechanics and the progressive difficulty feature. For the game mechanics, we will need to handle the movement of the snake and the collision detection with the food and the snake itself. For the progressive difficulty, we will increase the speed of the snake as the score increases.

## Python package name
```python
"py_snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "scoreboard.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Main{
        +start_game()
    }
    class Game{
        +int score
        +bool game_over
        +start()
        +pause()
        +resume()
    }
    class Snake{
        +list body
        +move()
        +grow()
        +check_collision()
    }
    class Food{
        +tuple position
        +generate()
    }
    class Scoreboard{
        +int high_score
        +update_score(int)
        +display_score()
    }
    Main "1" -- "1" Game: starts
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: generates
    Game "1" -- "1" Scoreboard: updates
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    participant SB as Scoreboard
    M->>G: start_game()
    G->>S: move()
    G->>F: generate()
    G->>S: check_collision()
    G->>SB: update_score(G.score)
    G->>SB: display_score()
    G->>M: game_over()
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
