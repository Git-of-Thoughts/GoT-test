## UI Design draft
The game will have a simple, clean design with a single bird character that the player controls. The bird will be in the center of the screen, with obstacles coming from the right side of the screen that the player must avoid. The score will be displayed at the top of the screen. The game will have a bright, colorful aesthetic to make it visually appealing.
