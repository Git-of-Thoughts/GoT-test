## Original Requirements
The boss has requested for the design of a content website for architects. The website should be similar to Pinterest with images generated by AIGC. The code for the website should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a user-friendly content website for architects",
    "Incorporate AIGC-generated images into the website",
    "Ensure the website is similar in functionality and design to Pinterest"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As an architect, I want to browse through a variety of AIGC-generated images to find inspiration for my projects",
    "As a user, I want to be able to save images I like to my personal board for future reference",
    "As a user, I want to be able to search for specific types of architectural designs",
    "As a user, I want to be able to upload my own images and share them with the community",
    "As a user, I want to interact with other users by commenting on and liking their posts"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Pinterest: A well-known platform for sharing and discovering new ideas. It has a user-friendly interface and a large user base, but it doesn't focus specifically on architecture",
    "ArchDaily: A website dedicated to architecture, but it lacks the social and interactive aspects of Pinterest",
    "Houzz: A platform for home renovation and design, providing a unique blend of products, pros, and inspiration. However, it's more focused on interior design than architecture",
    "Dwell: A platform for discovering modern architecture and design, but it doesn't allow users to upload their own content",
    "Architizer: A platform for architects to showcase their work, but it lacks the user-friendly interface of Pinterest",
    "Designboom: An online architecture magazine, but it doesn't have the interactive features of a social platform",
    "Archinect: A platform for architects to connect and share their work, but it doesn't have the visual appeal of Pinterest"
]
```

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement a user-friendly interface similar to Pinterest", "P0"),
    ("Incorporate AIGC-generated images into the website", "P0"),
    ("Allow users to save images to their personal board", "P0"),

```

## UI Design draft
The website should have a clean, minimalist design with a focus on the images. The homepage should display a grid of images, with options to filter and sort them. Each image should have a button to save it to the user's personal board. There should also be a search bar at the top of the page for users to find specific types of designs. The user's personal board and uploaded images should be accessible from a menu bar at the top of the page.
