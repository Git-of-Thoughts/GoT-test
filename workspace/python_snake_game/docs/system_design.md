## Implementation approach
The snake game will be implemented using Python's built-in modules and the open-source Pygame library for the game's graphical interface. The game will be designed in an object-oriented manner with classes for the main game, the snake, and the food. The game will progressively get harder by increasing the speed of the snake as the score increases. The game state (paused or running) will be managed using a simple boolean flag. The high score will be stored in a file and loaded each time the game starts.

## Python package name
```python
"python_snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "score_manager.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid

    class Main{
        +void run()
    }
    class Game{
        +bool is_running
        +int score
        +void start_game()
        +void pause_game()
        +void resume_game()
        +void end_game()
    }
    class Snake{
        +list body
        +str direction
        +void move()
        +void grow()
    }
    class Food{
        +tuple position
        +void generate()
    }
    class ScoreManager{
        +int high_score
        +void load_high_score()
        +void save_high_score()
    }
    Main -- Game: initiates
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: controls
    Game "1" -- "1" ScoreManager: uses
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid

    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    participant SM as ScoreManager
    M->>G: start_game()
    G->>SM: load_high_score()
    loop Game Loop
        G->>S: move()
        alt Collision with Food
            G->>F: generate()
            G->>S: grow()
            G->>G: increase score
        end
        alt Collision with Self or Border
            G->>G: end_game()
        end
        alt Pause Command
            G->>G: pause_game()
            opt Resume Command
                G->>G: resume_game()
            end
        end
    end
    G->>SM: save_high_score()
    G->>M: end game
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
