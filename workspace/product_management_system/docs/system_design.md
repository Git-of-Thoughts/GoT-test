## Implementation approach
The product will be developed using Python, which is a powerful and flexible programming language. We will use Flask, an open-source web framework, for the backend, and SQLite, an open-source database, for data storage. The Flask-SQLAlchemy extension will be used for object-relational mapping (ORM), and Flask-Migrate for database migration tasks. For the frontend, we will use Bootstrap, an open-source CSS framework, and Jinja2 for templates. We will also use pytest for testing, and pylint for code linting to ensure PEP8 compliance.

```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Product{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str description
        +bool is_efficient
        +bool is_successful
        +__init__(name: str, description: str, is_efficient: bool, is_successful: bool)
    }
    class Engineer{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str role
        +__init__(name: str, role: str)
    }
    class Boss{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str role
        +__init__(name: str, role: str)
    }
    class User{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str role
        +__init__(name: str, role: str)
    }
    Engineer "1" -- "*" Product: develops
    Boss "1" -- "*" Product: requires
    User "1" -- "*" Product: uses
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant E as Engineer
    participant B as Boss
    participant U as User
    participant P as Product
    M->>E: create engineer
    E->>M: return engineer
    M->>B: create boss
    B->>M: return boss
    M->>U: create user
    U->>M: return user
    E->>P: create product
    P->>E: return product
    B->>P: require product
    P->>B: return product
    U->>P: use product
    P->>U: return product
    M->>E: update product
    E->>P: update product
    P->>M: return updated product
    M->>E: delete product
    E->>P: delete product
    P->>M: return deletion confirmation
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
