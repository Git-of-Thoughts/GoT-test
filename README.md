The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic. It will have methods to start the game, handle user input, update the game state, and render the game on the console.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to get the current position of the snake, update the position, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Apple`: This class will represent the apple. It will have methods to get the current position of the apple and generate a new position for the apple.
4. `Point`: This class will represent a point on the grid. It will have attributes for the x and y coordinates.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.
