Assumptions:
1. We are creating a simple command-line based To-Do list application in Python.
2. The application will allow users to add tasks to a To-Do list.
3. The tasks will be stored in memory and will not persist when the application is closed.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. Class `Task`: This class will represent a task in the To-Do list. It will have attributes for the task description and a boolean to indicate if the task is completed.
2. Function `add_task`: This function will create a new `Task` object and add it to the To-Do list.
3. Function `main`: This function will serve as the entry point for the application. It will handle user input and call the appropriate functions.

Now, let's write the code for these classes and functions.
