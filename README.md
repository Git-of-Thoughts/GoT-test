The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this game are:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods for moving the snake, growing the snake when it eats food, and checking if the snake has collided with itself.

2. `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have a method for placing the food at a random location on the screen.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods for starting the game, ending the game, and handling the game logic (such as what happens when the snake eats food or collides with itself).

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point for the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
