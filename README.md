Based on the requirements and assumptions, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. `Game`: This class will be the main class that controls the game loop, events, and rendering.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check for collisions.
3. `Food`: This class will represent the food that the snake eats. It will have methods to place the food at a random location on the screen.
4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game loop.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`main.py`
