Assumptions:
1. The programming language to be used is Python.
2. The text-to-speech conversion will be done using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library.
3. The training dataset will be in the form of text files.
4. The program will be a command-line application.
5. The program will be used by developers or users comfortable with command-line interfaces.
6. The timeline for the completion of the program is not specified, so we will aim for a basic functional version first.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:
1. `TextToSpeech`: This class will handle the conversion of text to speech.
    - `__init__`: Initializes the class with necessary parameters.
    - `convert_text_to_speech`: Converts the given text to speech.
2. `TrainModel`: This class will handle the training of the model.
    - `__init__`: Initializes the class with necessary parameters.
    - `train`: Trains the model using the given dataset.
3. `main`: This function will serve as the entry point of the program.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.py
