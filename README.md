Based on the requirements, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic, including starting and ending the game, updating the game state, and handling user input.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Food`: This class will represent the food. It will have methods to place the food at a random location on the game board.
4. `Screen`: This class will handle the display of the game, including drawing the game board, the snake, and the food.

Now, let's start with the entrypoint file, `main.py`.
