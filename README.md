Understood. Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game:

1. `Game` class: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain the game loop and handle user input.
   - `__init__` method: Initializes the game.
   - `run` method: Starts the game loop.
   - `handle_input` method: Handles user input.
   - `update` method: Updates the game state.
   - `draw` method: Draws the game state to the console.

2. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake.
   - `__init__` method: Initializes the snake.
   - `move` method: Moves the snake in the current direction.
   - `grow` method: Increases the size of the snake.
   - `collides_with_self` method: Checks if the snake has collided with itself.

3. `Food` class: This class will represent the food.
   - `__init__` method: Initializes the food.
   - `respawn` method: Moves the food to a new random location.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
