Given the complexity of the project, we will use Django, a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django is a good choice for this project because it comes with a lot of built-in features that will help us to build a robust and scalable application.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. User: This class will represent a user in our system. It will have methods for creating, updating, and deleting a user.

2. Board: This class will represent a board in our system. It will have methods for creating, updating, and deleting a board.

3. Pin: This class will represent a pin in our system. It will have methods for creating, updating, and deleting a pin.

4. Comment: This class will represent a comment in our system. It will have methods for creating, updating, and deleting a comment.

5. Follow: This class will represent a follow relationship between two users in our system. It will have methods for creating, updating, and deleting a follow relationship.

6. AIGC: This class will be responsible for generating images using artificial intelligence. It will have a method for generating an image.

7. Views: This file will contain the functions that handle the requests and responses of our application.

8. URLs: This file will define the URL patterns for our application.

9. Settings: This file will contain the configuration settings for our application.

10. WSGI: This file will be the entry point for our application.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
