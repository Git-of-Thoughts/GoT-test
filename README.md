The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the 2048 game are:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain the game logic and the game state.
2. `Game.init()`: This method will initialize the game state.
3. `Game.playMove(direction)`: This method will make a move in the specified direction.
4. `Game.checkGameOver()`: This method will check if the game is over.
5. `Game.addRandomTile()`: This method will add a random tile in an empty spot on the board.
6. `Game.compress()`: This method will compress the grid after every step before and after merging the cells.
7. `Game.merge()`: This method will merge the cells in the grid after compressing.
8. `Game.reverse()`: This method will reverse the order of cells in the grid.
9. `Game.transpose()`: This method will get the transpose of the grid.
10. `Game.updateScore()`: This method will update the score after each merge operation.
11. `Game.canMove()`: This method will check if a move is possible.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
