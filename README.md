The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.

2. `Apple`: This class will represent the apple in the game. It will have a method to place the apple in a random location within the game grid.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and update the game state.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
