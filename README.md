The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game` class: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, user input, and game over condition.
2. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods for moving the snake, growing the snake, and checking if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Food` class: This class will represent the food. It will have a method for placing the food at a random location on the grid.
4. `draw_grid` function: This function will draw the current state of the game grid in the console.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
