Given the requirements, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this task. The core files will be:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website.
2. style.css: This file will contain all the CSS styles that will be applied to the HTML elements.
3. script.js: This file will contain all the JavaScript code that will provide interactivity to the website.

Let's start with the entry point file, which is index.html.
