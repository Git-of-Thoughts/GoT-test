The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game` class: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, user input, and game over condition.
2. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake, including its current position and direction, and methods to move and grow the snake.
3. `Apple` class: This class will represent the apple, including its current position and a method to place a new apple on the game board.
4. `Board` class: This class will represent the game board, including methods to draw the board and check for collisions.

Now, let's implement these classes in Python.
