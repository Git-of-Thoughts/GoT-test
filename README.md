Assumptions:
1. The game window size is 800x600 pixels.
2. The snake moves at a constant speed.
3. The snake grows by one segment each time it eats food.
4. The game ends when the snake hits the border or its own body.
5. The score increases by one each time the snake eats food.
6. There are no specific colors or sounds associated with the game events.
7. The game has a start screen and an end screen, and it displays the current score during the game.

Core classes, functions, methods:
1. `Game`: This class represents the game itself. It has methods to initialize the game, handle game events, update the game state, and render the game state to the screen.
2. `Snake`: This class represents the snake. It has methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has hit itself.
3. `Food`: This class represents the food. It has a method to place the food at a random position.
4. `main`: This function is the entry point of the program. It creates a `Game` object and starts the game loop.

Now let's write the code for each file.
