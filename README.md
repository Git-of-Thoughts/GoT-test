The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the game are:

1. `Point`: A class to represent a point in the grid. It will have two attributes, `x` and `y`, to represent the coordinates of the point.

2. `Snake`: A class to represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.

3. `Game`: A class to represent the game. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and handle user input.

4. `draw_grid`: A function to draw the current state of the game grid.

5. `generate_food`: A function to generate food at a random location on the grid.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
