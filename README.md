Given the requirements, we will use Python with Flask for the backend, and HTML/CSS for the frontend. We will also use a simple JSON file to store the data about the dinosaurs.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of the application. It will contain the Flask application and the routes for the website.

2. `dinosaurs.json`: This file will contain the data about the dinosaurs. Each dinosaur will be represented as a JSON object with properties for the name, description, and image URL.

3. `templates/index.html`: This is the main HTML template for the website. It will display a list of all dinosaurs.

4. `static/css/styles.css`: This file will contain the CSS styles for the website.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

app.py
