Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game:

1. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.

2. `Food` class: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have methods to place the food at a random location on the game board.

3. `Game` class: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and update the game state.

4. `main` function: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
