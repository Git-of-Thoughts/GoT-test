The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain the game loop and handle user input.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will contain methods for moving the snake, growing the snake, and checking for collisions.
3. `Apple`: This class will represent the apple. It will contain a method for randomly placing the apple on the grid.
4. `Point`: This class will represent a point on the grid. It will be used for the positions of the snake and the apple.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.
