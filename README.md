The core classes and functions for the snake game will be:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, user input, and game over conditions.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Food`: This class will represent the food. It will have a method to place the food at a random location.
4. `Screen`: This class will handle the display of the game, including the snake, food, and score.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
