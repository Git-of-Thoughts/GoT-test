The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this game are:

1. `Game` class: This will be the main class that controls the game loop, user input, and game over conditions.
2. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Fruit` class: This class will represent the fruit. It will have a method to place the fruit at a random location on the board.
4. `Board` class: This class will represent the game board. It will have methods to initialize the board, update the board, and print the board.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.
