Assumptions:
1. We will be creating a simple autoencoder for the purpose of dimensionality reduction.
2. We will use the MNIST dataset for training and testing the autoencoder.
3. We will use Keras, a popular deep learning library in Python, to build the autoencoder.
4. The autoencoder will consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder will compress the input and the decoder will reconstruct the input from the compressed representation.
5. The complexity of the autoencoder will be kept to a minimum for the sake of clarity and understanding.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. Autoencoder: This is the main class that will contain the encoder and decoder.
2. Encoder: This class will take in the input data and compress it.
3. Decoder: This class will take the compressed data and reconstruct the original input.
4. train: This function will train the autoencoder on the MNIST dataset.
5. test: This function will test the autoencoder's performance on the MNIST dataset.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
