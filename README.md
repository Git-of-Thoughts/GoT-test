The game will be divided into three main classes:

1. `Snake`: This class will handle the behavior of the snake, including its movement and growth.
2. `Food`: This class will handle the behavior of the food, including its placement on the game window.
3. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, collision detection, and score tracking.

The game will be implemented in a single Python file, `snake_game.py`, using the `pygame` library for the game window and user input.
