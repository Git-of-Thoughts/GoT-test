Assumptions:

1. The game will be a simple console-based snake game.
2. The snake will move in a grid layout.
3. The user will control the snake using the arrow keys.
4. The snake will grow by one unit each time it eats the food.
5. The game will end if the snake hits the grid boundary or its own body.
6. The game will not have any sound effects.
7. The game will not increase in difficulty over time.
