Given the assumptions, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `Snake`: A class representing the snake. It will have methods for moving the snake, growing the snake, and checking for collisions.
2. `Game`: A class representing the game. It will have methods for starting the game, ending the game, and updating the game state.
3. `views.py`: This file will contain the Django views for rendering the game page and handling game-related requests.
4. `urls.py`: This file will define the URL routes for the game.
5. `models.py`: This file will define the Django models for storing game-related data, if necessary.
6. `snake.js`: This file will contain the JavaScript code for rendering the game in the browser and handling user input.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`snake.py`
