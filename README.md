The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain methods to start the game, handle user input, update the game state, and check for game over conditions.

2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will contain methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.

3. `Food`: This class will represent the food. It will contain a method to place the food at a random location within the game area.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.
