Based on the assumptions, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. `Task`: A class to represent a task. It will have properties like `id`, `description`, and `completed`.

2. `TaskManager`: A class to manage tasks. It will have methods like `add_task`, `delete_task`, `mark_task_as_completed`, and `get_all_tasks`.

3. `StorageManager`: A class to handle storage. It will have methods like `save_tasks` and `load_tasks`.

4. `App`: A class to handle user interaction. It will have methods like `run`, `display_menu`, `handle_choice`, `add_task`, `delete_task`, `mark_task_as_completed`, and `view_tasks`.

Now, let's write the code for each class and function.
