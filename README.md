Based on your instructions, I'm going to create a simple Python application that prints a greeting message. The application will consist of two files: `main.py` which is the entry point of the application, and `greeting.py` which contains the logic for generating the greeting message.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It imports and uses the `Greeting` class from `greeting.py`.

2. `greeting.py`: This file contains the `Greeting` class. The `Greeting` class has a single method `generate_greeting` which returns a greeting message.

Now, let's write the code for each file:

main.py
