Based on the assumptions and the requirements, we will create a Python application that will allow Polycarp to manipulate and analyze binary words. The application will have the following core classes and functions:

1. `BinaryWord`: This class will represent a binary word. It will have methods to validate the binary word, count the number of 0s and 1s, and perform other operations.

2. `BinaryWordAnalyzer`: This class will be used to analyze a list of binary words. It will have methods to find the binary word with the most 0s, the most 1s, and other analysis functions.

3. `main.py`: This will be the entry point of the application. It will use the `BinaryWord` and `BinaryWordAnalyzer` classes to perform operations on the binary words.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

`binary_word.py`
