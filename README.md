Based on the assumptions and requirements, we will create a simple Python application for managing a To-Do list. The application will have the following core classes and functions:

1. `Todo` class: This class will represent a single To-Do item. It will have properties like `title`, `description`, and `status`.

2. `TodoList` class: This class will represent a list of To-Do items. It will have methods to add a new To-Do, remove a To-Do, and list all To-Dos.

3. `main.py` file: This will be the entry point of the application. It will handle user input and output.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`todo.py`
