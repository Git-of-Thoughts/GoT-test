The game will be implemented using Python's curses library, which is used for creating text-based user interfaces. The game will have the following core classes and functions:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods for moving the snake, growing the snake, and checking if the snake has collided with itself.

2. `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have a method for placing the food at a random location on the game board.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods for starting the game, ending the game, and updating the game state.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
