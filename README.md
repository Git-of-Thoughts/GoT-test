The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `app.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will contain the main Flask app and routes.
2. `chess.py`: This will contain the `ChessGame` class which will handle the logic of the chess game.
3. `firebase_service.py`: This will contain the `FirebaseService` class which will handle all interactions with Firebase, such as user authentication and database operations.
4. `templates/`: This directory will contain all the HTML templates for our website.
5. `static/`: This directory will contain all the static files like CSS and JavaScript files.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

app.py
