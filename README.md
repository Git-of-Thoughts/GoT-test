Based on your instructions, I'm going to create a simple Python application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This application will consist of two files: `main.py` (the entry point) and `greeting.py` (a module that contains the greeting logic).

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `Greeting` class: This class will be defined in `greeting.py` and will contain the logic for generating the greeting message.
2. `get_greeting` method: This method will be part of the `Greeting` class. It will return the greeting message.
3. `main` function: This function will be defined in `main.py`. It will create an instance of the `Greeting` class and print the greeting message to the console.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`greeting.py`
