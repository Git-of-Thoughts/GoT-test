The game will be implemented in a single Python file, `snake_game.py`. The core classes and functions are:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
2. `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have a method to place the food at a random location on the game board.
3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and handle user input.
4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.
