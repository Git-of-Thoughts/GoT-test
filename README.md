Based on the requirements and assumptions, we will need the following core classes and functions:

1. `Asset`: A class to represent an asset. It will have methods to fetch historical price data for the asset.
2. `DCA_Strategy`: A class to represent a dollar cost averaging strategy. It will have methods to calculate the return of the strategy over a specified time range.
3. `Sensitivity_Analysis`: A class to perform sensitivity analysis on the parameters of a DCA strategy. It will have methods to vary the parameters and calculate the resulting returns.
4. `Visualizer`: A class to visualize the results of the sensitivity analysis. It will have methods to generate interactive graphs or charts.
5. `main`: The entry point function that runs the web app. It will use the Streamlit library to create the user interface and handle user inputs.

Now let's write the code for each of these components. We'll start with the `main.py` file, which is the entry point of the application.
