Given the assumptions, we will be using the PySpice library in Python to simulate a basic inverting amplifier circuit. The core classes and functions necessary for this task are:

1. Circuit: This class from PySpice.Spice.Netlist is used to define the circuit.
2. OP: This class from PySpice.Spice.NgSpice.Shared is used to perform an operating point analysis.
3. plot: This function from matplotlib.pyplot is used to plot the output.

The entire code will be contained in a single file named `inverting_amplifier.py`.

Here is the content of the file:
