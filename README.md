Given the requirements and assumptions, we will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this task. The website will be static and client-side only. We will use a simple architecture with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

2. style.css: This file will contain all the CSS styles for the website.
3. script.js: This file will contain all the JavaScript code for the website.

Let's start with the entry point file, which is index.html:
