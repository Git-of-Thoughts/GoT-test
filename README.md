Assumptions:

1. The programming language to be used is Python.
2. The breadth-first search algorithm will be applied to a graph.
3. The graph is represented as an adjacency list.
4. The graph is unweighted and undirected.
5. The nodes of the graph are represented as integers.
6. The input to the algorithm is a graph and a start node.
7. The output of the algorithm is a list of nodes in the order they were visited.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `Graph`: This class represents the graph. It has methods to add nodes and edges.
2. `add_node`: This method is used to add a node to the graph.
3. `add_edge`: This method is used to add an edge between two nodes in the graph.
4. `breadth_first_search`: This function implements the breadth-first search algorithm. It takes a graph and a start node as input and returns a list of nodes in the order they were visited.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
