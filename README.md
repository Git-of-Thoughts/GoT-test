Given the complexity of creating a game like Candy Crush, it's not feasible to provide a full implementation in this format. However, I can provide a simplified Python version of a match-three game. This version will not include graphics or user interfaces, and will be played in the console.

Here are the core classes and functions:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain the game board and game logic.
   - `__init__`: Initializes a new game.
   - `create_board`: Creates a new game board.
   - `draw_board`: Prints the current game board to the console.
   - `swap`: Swaps two candies on the board.
   - `find_matches`: Finds all matches on the board.
   - `remove_matches`: Removes matches from the board and drops candies down.
   - `fill_board`: Fills the board with new candies after matches are removed.
   - `play`: Starts the game loop.

2. `Candy`: This class will represent a candy on the game board.
   - `__init__`: Initializes a new candy with a random type.

Now, let's write the code for these classes and functions.
