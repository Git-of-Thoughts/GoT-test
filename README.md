Assumptions:

1. The game will be a simple console-based snake game.
2. The snake will move in a grid layout.
3. The snake will start at a random position in the grid.
4. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
5. A piece of food will appear in a random position in the grid.
6. When the snake eats the food, the length of the snake increases by one unit.
7. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body.
8. The game will run on any platform that supports Python.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. Class `Game`: This will be the main class that controls the game logic.
   - Method `__init__`: Initializes the game.
   - Method `start`: Starts the game.
   - Method `end`: Ends the game.
   - Method `generate_food`: Generates food at a random position in the grid.
   - Method `update`: Updates the game state.

2. Class `Snake`: This class represents the snake.
   - Method `__init__`: Initializes the snake.
   - Method `move`: Moves the snake in a given direction.
   - Method `grow`: Increases the length of the snake.
   - Method `check_collision`: Checks if the snake has collided with the wall or itself.

3. Class `Grid`: This class represents the grid.
   - Method `__init__`: Initializes the grid.
   - Method `draw`: Draws the grid.

4. Function `main`: This is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the `Game` class and starts the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
