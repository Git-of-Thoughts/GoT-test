The core classes and functions for the snake game will be:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic. It will have methods to start the game, handle user input, update the game state, and check for game over conditions.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Food`: This class will represent the food. It will have a method to place the food at a random location on the game board.
4. `Board`: This class will represent the game board. It will have methods to draw the board, the snake, and the food.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.
