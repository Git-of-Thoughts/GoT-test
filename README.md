Given the assumptions, we will be creating a simple command-line based to-do list application using Python. The application will have the following functionalities:

1. Add a task
2. Mark a task as complete
3. Delete a task
4. Edit a task
5. List all tasks

We will be using the following core classes and methods:

1. `Task`: A class to represent a task. It will have properties like `title`, `description`, `is_completed` and methods like `mark_as_complete`.
2. `TodoList`: A class to represent the to-do list. It will have properties like `tasks` (a list of `Task` objects) and methods like `add_task`, `delete_task`, `edit_task`, `mark_task_as_complete`, and `list_tasks`.

Here is the code for each file:

task.py
