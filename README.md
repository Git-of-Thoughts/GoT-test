Given the task, we will need to create a single R script file that will handle the data loading, data processing, statistical testing, and plotting. The script will be organized into functions for modularity and clarity.

Here are the core functions we will need:

1. `load_data`: This function will load the CSV data into a data frame.
2. `calculate_p_values`: This function will perform a t-test on each category in the data and return the p-values.
3. `create_bar_plot`: This function will create the bar plot and add the p-values as text above the bars.

Now, let's write the code for the R script.

bar_plot_with_p_values.R
