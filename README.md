Given the assumptions, we will need two files:

1. `server.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will contain a simple Flask server that serves our webpage. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML file that will be served by our Flask server. It contains the greeting message.

Let's start with the `server.py` file:
