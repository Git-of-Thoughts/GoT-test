The project will be a simple text-based adventure game. The player will be able to move between rooms, pick up items, and use items. The game will end when the player reaches the final room.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `Room`: This class will represent a room in the game. It will have properties for the room's description, the items in the room, and the rooms that can be reached from this room.
2. `Player`: This class will represent the player. It will have properties for the player's current room and the items the player is carrying.
3. `Item`: This class will represent an item that the player can pick up.
4. `main`: This function will be the entry point for the game. It will create the game world and start the game loop.
5. `game_loop`: This function will handle the main game loop. It will prompt the player for input and handle the player's actions.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
