The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the game are:

1. `Game` class: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, collision detection, and game over condition.
2. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake, including its current position, direction, and length.
3. `Food` class: This class will represent the food, including its current position.
4. `draw_board` function: This function will draw the current state of the game board.
5. `get_user_input` function: This function will get the user's input for the direction of the snake.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
