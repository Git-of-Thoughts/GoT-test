Given the instructions, I'm going to assume that we are creating a simple Python application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This application will be structured in a modular way, with separate files for the main function and the print function. 

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will import and call the `print_message` function from `hello_world.py`.

2. `hello_world.py`: This file will contain a function `print_message` that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

Now, let's write the code for each file:

main.py
