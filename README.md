Based on the assumptions, we will need the following core functions:

1. `load_data`: This function will load the Google stock price data from the CSV file using pandas.
2. `plot_line_chart`: This function will plot a line chart of the stock prices over time using matplotlib.
3. `plot_histogram`: This function will plot a histogram of the volume of stocks traded using matplotlib.
4. `display_statistics`: This function will display statistical analysis of the stock prices.

The entry point of the application will be `app.py`, which will contain the main logic of the Streamlit app.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
