Assumptions:
1. The game will be a simple text-based adventure game.
2. The game will be console-based.
3. The game will have a single player who will navigate through different rooms, picking up items and avoiding traps.
4. The game will end when the player reaches the final room or falls into a trap.
5. The game will be written in Python 3.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `Game`: This class will be the main driver of the game. It will handle the game loop and user input.
2. `Room`: This class will represent a room in the game. It will contain items and possibly a trap.
3. `Player`: This class will represent the player. It will keep track of the player's inventory and current room.
4. `Item`: This class will represent an item that the player can pick up.
5. `Trap`: This class will represent a trap that can end the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.
