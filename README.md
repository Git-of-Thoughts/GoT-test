Assumptions:
1. The game window will be 800x600 pixels.
2. The snake will start at a moderate speed, and the speed will increase as the game progresses.
3. If the snake hits the border, the game will end. The snake will not be allowed to cross itself.
4. There will be a score display at the top of the game window. The snake will be green, the food red, and the background black.
5. The game will start with a basic level, without any power-ups or different levels.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:
1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
2. `Food`: This class will represent the food. It will have a method to place the food at a random location.
3. `Game`: This class will represent the game. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and update the game state.
4. `draw`: This function will draw the game window, the snake, and the food.
5. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create instances of the `Game`, `Snake`, and `Food` classes and start the game loop.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
