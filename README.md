Assumptions:
- We are creating a simple To-Do list application in Python.
- The application will allow users to add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as completed.
- The tasks will be stored in memory and will not persist when the application is closed.
- The application will be a command-line application.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `Task`: A class to represent a task. It will have properties for the task description and a flag to indicate if the task is completed.
2. `ToDoList`: A class to manage the list of tasks. It will have methods to add a task, view all tasks, and mark a task as completed.
3. `main`: The entry point function. It will handle user input and call the appropriate methods on the `ToDoList` object.

Now, let's write the code for these classes and functions.

`task.py`
