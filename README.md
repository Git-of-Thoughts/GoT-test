Based on the information provided, I'm going to create a simple Python project that uses machine learning to make predictions. The project will be structured in a modular way, with separate files for data processing, model training, and prediction. 

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `DataProcessor` class: This class will be responsible for loading and preprocessing the data. It will have methods like `load_data` and `preprocess_data`.

2. `ModelTrainer` class: This class will be responsible for training the machine learning model. It will have methods like `train_model` and `save_model`.

3. `Predictor` class: This class will be responsible for making predictions using the trained model. It will have methods like `load_model` and `predict`.

4. `main` function: This will be the entry point of the application. It will use the above classes to load data, train a model, and make predictions.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`dataprocessor.py`
