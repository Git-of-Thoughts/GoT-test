Given the complexity of the task, we will need to create several files and classes to handle different aspects of the problem. Here is a brief overview of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `main.cu`: This is the entry point of the application. It will handle user input and output, and coordinate the other components of the application.

2. `tic_tac_toe.cuh`: This file will contain the definition of the `TicTacToe` class, which will represent the state of a Tic Tac Toe game. It will have methods for making moves, checking the game status, and printing the game state.

3. `tic_tac_toe.cu`: This file will contain the implementation of the `TicTacToe` class.

4. `solver.cuh`: This file will contain the definition of the `Solver` class, which will use CUDA to solve a given Tic Tac Toe game. It will have a method for finding the best move given a game state.

5. `solver.cu`: This file will contain the implementation of the `Solver` class.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of each file.

`main.cu`:
