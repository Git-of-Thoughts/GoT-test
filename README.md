The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `OneHotEncoder`: This class will be used to one-hot encode the amino acid sequences.
2. `Embedding`: This class will be used to convert the one-hot encoded sequences into a lower-dimensional space.
3. `MLPClassifier`: This class will be used to perform the MLP classification.
4. `train_test_split`: This function will be used to split the data into training and testing sets.
5. `accuracy_score`: This function will be used to evaluate the performance of the MLP classifier.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, which is `main.py`.
