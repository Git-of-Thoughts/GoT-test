Assumptions:
1. The game will be a simple version of Tetris with basic features such as moving and rotating Tetriminos, clearing lines, and scoring.
2. The game will be developed using Python 3.8.
3. The game will be a console-based game for simplicity.
4. No external libraries will be used. The game will be developed using only the Python standard library.
5. There is no specific deadline for this project.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain methods for starting the game, handling user input, updating the game state, and rendering the game.
2. `Board`: This class will represent the game board. It will contain methods for adding a Tetrimino to the board, checking if a line is full, and clearing full lines.
3. `Tetrimino`: This class will represent a Tetrimino. It will contain methods for rotating the Tetrimino and checking if a move is valid.
4. `Point`: This class will represent a point on the game board. It will contain attributes for the x and y coordinates.
5. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
