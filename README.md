The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game` class: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, user input, and game over conditions.
2. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake, including its current position, direction, and body segments.
3. `Apple` class: This class will represent the apple, including its current position.
4. `draw` function: This function will draw the game state to the console.
5. `main` function: This function will create the game objects and start the game loop.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
