The game will be developed using Python with the Pygame library for the graphical interface. The core classes and functions will be:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic, including the game board and the movement of the fruits.
2. `Fruit`: This class will represent a fruit on the game board.
3. `main()`: This function will be the entry point of the game, initializing the game and handling the game loop.

Now, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.
