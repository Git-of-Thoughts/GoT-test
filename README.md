The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself or the borders of the game area.

2. `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have a method to place the food at a random location within the game area.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and handle the game logic (e.g., what happens when the snake eats food or collides with itself or the borders).

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
