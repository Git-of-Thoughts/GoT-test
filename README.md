Based on the given instructions, I will create a simple Python project that uses Flask to create a web application. This application will have a single endpoint that returns a greeting message. The project will be structured following the best practices for Python projects.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the Flask application instance and the route definitions.
2. `greeting.py`: This module will contain the `Greeting` class, which will be responsible for generating the greeting message.
3. `test_greeting.py`: This module will contain the tests for the `Greeting` class.

Now, let's create the content of each file.

`app.py`
