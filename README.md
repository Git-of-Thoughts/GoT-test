The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the Python Snake Game are:

1. Class `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to initialize the snake, move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself or the walls.

2. Class `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have methods to initialize the food and randomly place the food on the game board.

3. Function `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will handle the game loop, user input, and game over conditions.

4. Function `draw_board`: This function will draw the game board, the snake, and the food.

5. Function `get_user_input`: This function will get the user input to control the direction of the snake.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
