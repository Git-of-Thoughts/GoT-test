The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain methods to start the game, handle user input, update the game state, and render the game state to the console.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will contain methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Apple`: This class will represent the apple. It will contain a method to place the apple at a random location on the grid.
4. `Point`: This class will represent a point on the grid. It will contain x and y coordinates.

Now, let's write the code for each class in separate files.
