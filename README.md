The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.

2. `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have a method to place the food at a random location on the grid.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to start the game, update the game state, and check if the game is over.

4. `SpotifyPlayer`: This class will handle playing songs from Spotify. It will have methods to authenticate with Spotify, get a random song from a playlist, and play a song.

5. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create instances of the above classes and control the flow of the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
