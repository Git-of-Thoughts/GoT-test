The game will be implemented in a single Python file, `snake_game.py`. The core classes and functions will be:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake itself. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
2. `Food`: This class will represent the food that the snake eats. It will have a method to place the food at a random location on the grid.
3. `Game`: This class will represent the game as a whole. It will have methods to start the game, handle user input, update the game state, and display the current state of the game.
4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create a `Game` object and start the game.
