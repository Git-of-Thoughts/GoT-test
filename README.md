The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this project are:

1. `TodoList`: This class will represent the todo list. It will have methods to add a task, list tasks, search tasks, and clear all tasks.
2. `addTask(task)`: This method will add a new task to the todo list.
3. `listTasks()`: This method will return all tasks in the todo list.
4. `searchTasks(query)`: This method will return tasks that match the search query.
5. `clearTasks()`: This method will remove all tasks from the todo list.

Now, let's write the code for these classes and methods.

The entry point of the application will be `index.html` file.
