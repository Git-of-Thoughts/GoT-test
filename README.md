The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `main.go`: This is the entry point of the application. It contains the main function which initializes the game and starts the game loop.

2. `game.go`: This file contains the Game struct and its methods. The Game struct holds the state of the game, including the snake, the food, and the score. The methods in this file handle the game logic, such as updating the game state and checking for game over conditions.

3. `snake.go`: This file contains the Snake struct and its methods. The Snake struct represents the snake in the game. The methods in this file handle the movement and growth of the snake.

4. `food.go`: This file contains the Food struct and its methods. The Food struct represents the food in the game. The methods in this file handle the placement of the food.

5. `utils.go`: This file contains utility functions for the game, such as functions for generating random numbers.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.go
