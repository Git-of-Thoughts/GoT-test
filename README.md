Given the requirements, we will be using Python with Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. We will also use a simple JSON file to store the data about the dinosaurs.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application and the routes for our website.

2. `dinosaurs.json`: This file will store the data about the dinosaurs. Each dinosaur will have a name and a description.

3. `templates/index.html`: This is the main page of our website. It will display the list of dinosaurs.

4. `static/styles.css`: This file will contain the CSS styles for our website.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

app.py
