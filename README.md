Given the requirements and assumptions, we will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this task. We will be using a simple static site generator, Jekyll, to manage the content and layout of the site. 

Here are the core files, classes, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will serve as the entry point of the website. It will contain the main structure of the website and include other HTML files for different sections.

2. `main.css`: This is the main CSS file that will contain all the styles for the website. It will define the color scheme and layout of the website.

3. `main.js`: This is the main JavaScript file that will contain all the interactive elements of the website.

4. `_config.yml`: This is the configuration file for Jekyll. It will define the base URL, title, description, and other settings for the website.

5. `about.html`, `contact.html`, `experience.html`, `skills.html`, `interests.html`: These are the HTML files for different sections of the website. They will be included in the `index.html` file.

6. `assets/`: This directory will contain all the images, fonts, and other assets used in the website.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`index.html`
