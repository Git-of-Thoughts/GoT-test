Based on the requirements and assumptions, we will need the following functions:

1. `isValid`: This function will check if a given number can be placed at a given position in the Sudoku grid. It will check the row, column, and 3x3 box for any conflicts.

2. `solveSudoku`: This function will use a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It will iterate through the Sudoku grid, and for each empty cell, it will try to place a number from 1 to 9. If the number is valid, it will recursively call `solveSudoku` to solve the rest of the grid. If the grid cannot be solved, it will backtrack and try the next number.

3. `printGrid`: This function will print the solved Sudoku grid.

We will implement all these functions in a single JavaScript file named `sudokuSolver.js`.
