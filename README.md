Based on the task, we will need to create a Python script that will scrape the Donews website for technology news and then send the news to a specified email address. We will use the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and the smtplib library for sending emails.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `NewsScraper`: This class will be responsible for scraping the Donews website for technology news. It will have the following methods:
    - `__init__`: This method will initialize the `NewsScraper` object.
    - `get_news`: This method will scrape the Donews website for technology news and return the news as a string.

2. `EmailSender`: This class will be responsible for sending the news to a specified email address. It will have the following methods:
    - `__init__`: This method will initialize the `EmailSender` object.
    - `send_email`: This method will send an email with the news to a specified email address.

3. `main`: This function will create a `NewsScraper` object, use it to get the news, create an `EmailSender` object, and use it to send the news to a specified email address.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
