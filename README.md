The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself or the borders of the game window.
2. `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have a method to place the food at a random location within the game window.
3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and update the game state (including the snake's position and the score).
4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
