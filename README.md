Given the complexity of the task, we will use Python with the Kivy framework for developing the mobile application. Kivy is a Python library for rapid development of applications that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.

The core classes and methods necessary for this application are:

1. `PopCatGame`: This is the main class for the game. It will handle the game logic such as counting taps, managing the timer, and updating the score.

2. `CountryRanking`: This class will handle the ranking of countries. It will keep track of the total score for each country and provide a method to get the current rankings.

3. `Player`: This class will represent a player. It will store the player's score and country.

4. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will create an instance of `PopCatGame` and start the game.

5. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies required to run the application.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.py
