The core classes and functions for the snake game will be:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain methods to start the game, handle user input, update the game state, and render the game on the screen.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will contain methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself or the edge of the screen.
3. `Fruit`: This class will represent the fruit. It will contain a method to place the fruit at a random location on the screen.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.
