The core classes and functions for the snake game will be:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, user input, and game over condition.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake, including its current position, direction, and length.
3. `Food`: This class will represent the food that the snake can eat to grow longer.

The game will be implemented in a single Python file for simplicity. Here is the content of the file:
