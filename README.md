The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the Python Snake Game are:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain the game loop and handle the game logic.
   - `__init__`: This method will initialize the game.
   - `run`: This method will start the game loop.
   - `end`: This method will end the game.
   - `draw`: This method will draw the game state on the console.
   - `handle_input`: This method will handle user input.
   - `update`: This method will update the game state.

2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake.
   - `__init__`: This method will initialize the snake.
   - `move`: This method will move the snake.
   - `grow`: This method will make the snake grow.
   - `collides_with_self`: This method will check if the snake collides with itself.
   - `collides_with`: This method will check if the snake collides with a given point.

3. `Fruit`: This class will represent the fruit.
   - `__init__`: This method will initialize the fruit.
   - `respawn`: This method will respawn the fruit at a random location.

4. `Point`: This class will represent a point in the game grid.
   - `__init__`: This method will initialize the point.
   - `equals`: This method will check if the point equals another point.

Now, let's implement these classes, functions, and methods.
