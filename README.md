The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this game are:

1. Class `Point`: This class will represent a point in the game grid. It will have two attributes, `x` and `y`, representing the coordinates of the point.

2. Class `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have attributes for the snake's body (a list of `Point` objects), direction, and whether the snake is alive.

3. Class `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have attributes for the game grid, the snake, the food, and the score. It will also have methods for starting the game, handling user input, updating the game state, and displaying the game state.

4. Function `main`: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create a `Game` object and start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
