The game will be implemented in a single Python file, `snake_game.py`. The game will be implemented using the `curses` library, which is a part of the Python standard library and allows for the creation of text-based user interfaces.

The core classes and functions will be:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.

2. `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have a method to place the food at a random location within the game area.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and handle the game logic (such as checking if the snake has eaten the food or collided with itself).

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.

Here is the content of the `snake_game.py` file:
