Assumptions:

1. The network association model will be a simple graph model where nodes represent entities and edges represent associations between entities.
2. The data will be in the form of a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an association between two entities.
3. The output will be a visual representation of the network graph.
4. The Python libraries used will be NetworkX for creating and manipulating the network graph, and Matplotlib for visualizing the graph.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `NetworkAssociationModel`: This is the main class that represents the network association model. It will have methods for adding nodes and edges to the graph, and for visualizing the graph.
2. `add_node(self, node)`: This method will add a node to the graph.
3. `add_edge(self, node1, node2)`: This method will add an edge between two nodes in the graph.
4. `visualize(self)`: This method will create a visual representation of the graph.

Now let's write the code.
