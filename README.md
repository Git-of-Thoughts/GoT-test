Given the assumptions, we will be developing this game using Python and the Pygame library. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides functionalities such as drawing on the screen and handling events (like key presses and mouse movements).

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `Bird`: This class will represent the bird character in the game. It will have methods for flapping (rising up), falling, and checking for collisions.

2. `Pipe`: This class will represent the obstacles that the bird has to navigate through. It will have methods for moving the pipes and checking for collisions with the bird.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods for starting the game, handling events (like the player tapping the screen), updating the game state, and drawing the game state on the screen.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game loop.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.
