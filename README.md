The core classes and functions necessary for this game are:

1. `Game` class: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, user input, and game over conditions.
2. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Food` class: This class will represent the food. It will have a method to place the food at a random location within the game area.
4. `Point` class: This class will represent a point in the 2D game area. It will be used to represent the position of the snake and the food.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.
