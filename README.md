Based on the assumptions, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. `Point`: A class to represent a point on the grid. It will have two properties, `x` and `y`, to represent its coordinates.

2. `Snake`: A class to represent the snake. It will have properties for its position, direction, and body. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.

3. `Game`: A class to represent the game. It will have properties for the snake, apple, and score. It will have methods to start the game, handle user input, update the game state, and draw the game.

4. `main`: A function to start the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
