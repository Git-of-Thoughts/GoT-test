Based on the assumptions, we will be creating a simple web application using Flask, a Python micro web framework. The application will have a SQLite database to store the tasks. We will use SQLAlchemy as the ORM to interact with the database.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `Task` class: This class will represent a task in the to-do list. It will have attributes for the task name, completion status, and date added.

2. `add_task` function: This function will add a new task to the database.

3. `complete_task` function: This function will mark a task as complete in the database.

4. `delete_task` function: This function will delete a task from the database.

5. `search_task` function: This function will search for tasks based on the task name.

6. `index` function: This function will render the main page of the web application.

7. `app` object: This is the main Flask application object.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, `app.py`.
