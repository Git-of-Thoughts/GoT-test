The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the game are:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods to start the game, end the game, and update the game state.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself or the edge of the board.
3. `Fruit`: This class will represent the fruit. It will have a method to place the fruit at a random location on the board.
4. `Board`: This class will represent the game board. It will have methods to draw the board and update the board state.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.
