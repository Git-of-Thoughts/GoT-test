Based on the assumptions and the requirements, we will create a simple Python application to manage a list of "todos". The application will have the ability to add a new task, list all tasks, and mark a task as completed.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `Todo`: A class to represent a single todo item. It will have properties like `id`, `task`, and `completed`.

2. `TodoList`: A class to represent a list of todos. It will have methods like `add_todo`, `get_all_todos`, and `mark_as_completed`.

3. `main.py`: The entry point of the application. It will interact with the user and use the `TodoList` class to manage the todos.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`todo.py`
