The game will be implemented in a single Python file named `snake_game.py`. The game will be implemented using the `curses` library, which is used for creating text-based user interfaces. The game will have the following classes and functions:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods for moving the snake, growing the snake, and checking if the snake has collided with itself.

2. `Apple`: This class will represent the apple in the game. It will have a method for placing the apple at a random location within the game area.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods for starting the game, ending the game, and handling the game logic.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game.
