Given the simplicity of the task, there is no need for multiple files, classes, or methods. The task can be accomplished with a single Python file containing a single line of code. However, for the sake of this exercise, I will create a Python project with a main file that calls a function from another file to print "Hello, World!".

Here are the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will import and call the `print_hello_world` function from `hello_world.py`.

2. `hello_world.py`: This file will contain a function `print_hello_world` that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages that the project depends on. In this case, there are no dependencies, so the file will be empty.

Here is the content of each file:

main.py
```python
from hello_world import print_hello_world

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_hello_world()
```

hello_world.py
```python
def print_hello_world():
    """Prints 'Hello, World!' to the console."""
    print("Hello, World!")
```

requirements.txt
```
# This file lists the Python packages that the project depends on.
# Since this project does not have any dependencies, this file is empty.
```

To run the project, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and run `python main.py`. The program should print "Hello, World!" to the console.
