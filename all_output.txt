The game will be implemented in a single Python file, `snake_game.py`. The core classes and functions will be:

1. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake itself. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
2. `Food`: This class will represent the food that the snake eats. It will have a method to place the food at a random location on the grid.
3. `Game`: This class will represent the game as a whole. It will have methods to start the game, handle user input, update the game state, and display the current state of the game.
4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create a `Game` object and start the game.

snake_game.py
```python
import random
import curses

class Snake:
    def __init__(self, window, head_pos):
        self.body = [head_pos]
        self.window = window

    def move(self, direction):
        # Move the snake in the given direction
        pass

    def grow(self):
        # Add a new segment to the snake's body
        pass

    def has_collided_with_self(self):
        # Check if the snake has collided with itself
        pass

class Food:
    def __init__(self, window, pos):
        self.pos = pos
        self.window = window

    def place(self):
        # Place the food at a random location on the grid
        pass

class Game:
    def __init__(self, window):
        self.window = window
        self.snake = Snake(window, (10, 10))
        self.food = Food(window, self.snake.body[0])

    def start(self):
        # Start the game
        pass

    def handle_input(self):
        # Handle user input
        pass

    def update(self):
        # Update the game state
        pass

    def display(self):
        # Display the current state of the game
        pass

def main():
    # Create a new window using curses
    window = curses.initscr()
    curses.curs_set(0)
    window.timeout(100)

    game = Game(window)
    game.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is the basic structure of the game. The next step is to implement the logic for each method in the `Snake`, `Food`, and `Game` classes.
