Based on the requirements, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic, including starting and ending the game, updating the game state, and handling user input.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Food`: This class will represent the food. It will have methods to place the food at a random location on the game board.
4. `Screen`: This class will handle the display of the game, including drawing the game board, the snake, and the food.

Now, let's start with the entrypoint file, `main.py`.

main.py
```python
from game import Game

def main():
    game = Game()
    game.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, let's move on to the `game.py` file.

game.py
```python
import random
from snake import Snake
from food import Food
from screen import Screen

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.food = Food()
        self.screen = Screen()
        self.is_game_over = False

    def run(self):
        while not self.is_game_over:
            self.screen.draw(self.snake, self.food)
            self.handle_input()
            self.update()

    def handle_input(self):
        # Handle user input to move the snake

    def update(self):
        # Update the game state
```

Next, let's implement the `snake.py` file.

snake.py
```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.body = [(0, 0)]
        self.direction = "right"

    def move(self):
        # Move the snake in the current direction

    def grow(self):
        # Add a new segment to the snake's body

    def check_collision(self):
        # Check if the snake has collided with itself
```

Next, let's implement the `food.py` file.

food.py
```python
import random

class Food:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = self.random_position()

    def random_position(self):
        # Return a random position for the food
```

Finally, let's implement the `screen.py` file.

screen.py
```python
class Screen:
    def draw(self, snake, food):
        # Draw the game board, the snake, and the food
```

Please note that the code above is a high-level skeleton of the game and does not include the implementation details of each method. The actual implementation will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the game.
