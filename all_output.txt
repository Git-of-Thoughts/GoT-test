Based on the given instructions, I will create a simple Python project that uses Flask to create a web application. This application will have a single endpoint that returns a greeting message. The project will be structured following the best practices for Python projects.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the Flask application instance and the route definitions.
2. `greeting.py`: This module will contain the `Greeting` class, which will be responsible for generating the greeting message.
3. `test_greeting.py`: This module will contain the tests for the `Greeting` class.

Now, let's create the content of each file.

`app.py`
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from greeting import Greeting

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    greeting = Greeting()
    return jsonify(greeting.message())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

`greeting.py`
```python
class Greeting:
    def message(self):
        return 'Hello, World!'
```

`test_greeting.py`
```python
import pytest
from greeting import Greeting

def test_greeting_message():
    greeting = Greeting()
    assert greeting.message() == 'Hello, World!'
```

Finally, we need to create a `requirements.txt` file to specify the project dependencies.

`requirements.txt`
```plaintext
flask==1.1.2
pytest==6.2.4
```

This project can be run by executing the `app.py` script. The tests can be run by executing the `pytest` command in the project root directory.
