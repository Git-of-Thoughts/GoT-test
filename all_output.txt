The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain the game loop and handle user input.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will contain methods for moving the snake, growing the snake, and checking for collisions.
3. `Apple`: This class will represent the apple. It will contain a method for randomly placing the apple on the grid.
4. `Point`: This class will represent a point on the grid. It will be used for the positions of the snake and the apple.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.

snake_game.py
```python

from snake import Snake
from apple import Apple
from point import Point

class Game:
    def __init__(self, grid_size):
        self.grid_size = grid_size
        self.snake = Snake(Point(grid_size // 2, grid_size // 2))
        self.apple = Apple(self.grid_size)

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.snake.move()
            if self.snake.head == self.apple.position:
                self.snake.grow()
                self.apple = Apple(self.grid_size)
            elif self.snake.check_collision(self.grid_size):
                break
            self.draw()

    def draw(self):
        for i in range(self.grid_size):
            for j in range(self.grid_size):
                point = Point(i, j)
                if self.snake.head == point:
                    print("S", end="")
                elif point in self.snake.body:
                    print("s", end="")
                elif self.apple.position == point:
                    print("A", end="")
                else:
                    print(".", end="")

        self.body.pop()

    def grow(self):

    def check_collision(self, grid_size):
        return (self.head in self.body or
                self.head.x < 0 or self.head.y < 0 or

This is a simple implementation of the snake game in Python. The game is played in the console. The user enters 'w', 'a', 's', or 'd' to move the snake up, left, down, or right, respectively. The game ends when the snake collides with the grid boundary or with itself.
