Assumptions:
1. We are creating a simple command-line based To-Do list application in Python.
2. The application will allow users to add tasks to a To-Do list.
3. The tasks will be stored in memory and will not persist when the application is closed.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. Class `Task`: This class will represent a task in the To-Do list. It will have attributes for the task description and a boolean to indicate if the task is completed.
2. Function `add_task`: This function will create a new `Task` object and add it to the To-Do list.
3. Function `main`: This function will serve as the entry point for the application. It will handle user input and call the appropriate functions.

Now, let's write the code for these classes and functions.

main.py
```python
from task import Task

def add_task(task_list, task_description):
    """
    Adds a new task to the task list.
    """
    task = Task(task_description)
    task_list.append(task)

def main():
    """
    The main function of the application.
    """
    task_list = []
    while True:
        task_description = input("Enter a task (or 'quit' to stop): ")
        if task_description.lower() == 'quit':
            break
        add_task(task_list, task_description)
    print("Here are your tasks:")
    for task in task_list:
        print(task)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

task.py
```python
class Task:
    """
    Represents a task in the To-Do list.
    """
    def __init__(self, description):
        self.description = description
        self.is_completed = False

    def __str__(self):
        return self.description
```

requirements.txt
```
# No external dependencies
```

This Python application can be run from the command line with the command `python main.py`. The user can enter tasks one at a time, and when they're done, they can enter 'quit' to stop and see a list of their tasks.
