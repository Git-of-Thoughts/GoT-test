Given the instructions, I'm going to assume that we are creating a simple Python application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This application will be structured in a modular way, with separate files for the main function and the print function. 

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will import and call the `print_message` function from `hello_world.py`.

2. `hello_world.py`: This file will contain a function `print_message` that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

Now, let's write the code for each file:

main.py
```python
from hello_world import print_message

def main():
    print_message()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

hello_world.py
```python
def print_message():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

The `main.py` file imports the `print_message` function from `hello_world.py` and calls it. The `hello_world.py` file defines the `print_message` function, which prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

The application can be run by executing the `main.py` file. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line in `main.py` ensures that the `main` function is only called when `main.py` is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module.

The `requirements.txt` file for this Python project would be empty, as no external libraries are used.

```
```

This completes the architecture for this simple Python application.
