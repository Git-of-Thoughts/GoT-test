Given the assumptions, we will be using the PySpice library in Python to simulate a basic inverting amplifier circuit. The core classes and functions necessary for this task are:

1. Circuit: This class from PySpice.Spice.Netlist is used to define the circuit.
2. OP: This class from PySpice.Spice.NgSpice.Shared is used to perform an operating point analysis.
3. plot: This function from matplotlib.pyplot is used to plot the output.

The entire code will be contained in a single file named `inverting_amplifier.py`.

Here is the content of the file:

inverting_amplifier.py
```python
import PySpice.Logging.Logging as Logging
logger = Logging.setup_logging()

from PySpice.Doc.ExampleTools import find_libraries
from PySpice.Probe.Plot import plot
from PySpice.Spice.Library import SpiceLibrary
from PySpice.Spice.Netlist import Circuit
from PySpice.Unit import *

# Define the circuit
circuit = Circuit('Inverting Amplifier')

circuit.V(1, '+Vcc', circuit.gnd, 15@u_V)
circuit.V(2, '-Vcc', circuit.gnd, -15@u_V)
circuit.V(3, 'input', circuit.gnd, 'sine(0 10m 1k)')

circuit.R(1, 'input', 2, 10@u_kΩ)
circuit.R(2, 2, 'output', 100@u_kΩ)
circuit.C(1, 2, 'output', 10@u_uF)
circuit.X(1, 'OP07', 'NC', '+Vcc', '-Vcc', 2, 'output')

# Define the OP07 in the library
libraries_path = find_libraries()
spice_library = SpiceLibrary(libraries_path)
circuit.include(spice_library['OP07'])

# Perform an operating point analysis
simulator = circuit.simulator(temperature=25, nominal_temperature=25)
analysis = simulator.transient(step_time=1@u_us, end_time=1@u_ms)

# Plot the output
plot(analysis['output'])
```

This script first defines the circuit, including the power supply, input signal, resistors, capacitor, and the opamp itself. It then performs an operating point analysis to simulate the circuit's behavior over time. Finally, it plots the output signal.

Please note that this script assumes that the OP07 model is available in the Spice library. If it's not, you'll need to replace 'OP07' with the name of a model that is available in your library.

Also, remember to install the necessary libraries by running `pip install PySpice matplotlib` in your terminal before running the script.
