Assumptions:
1. The game will be a simple text-based adventure game.
2. The game will be for all ages.
3. The game will have a fantasy theme.
4. The game will have a scoring system based on the player's choices.
5. The game will be single-player.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `Game` class: This will be the main class that controls the game flow.
2. `start_game` method: This method will start the game.
3. `Player` class: This class will represent the player.
4. `Location` class: This class will represent the different locations in the game.
5. `Choice` class: This class will represent the different choices a player can make.
6. `Score` class: This class will keep track of the player's score.

Now, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.

main.py
```python
from game import Game

def main():
    game = Game()
    game.start_game()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

game.py
```python
from player import Player
from location import Location
from score import Score

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = Player()
        self.location = Location()
        self.score = Score()

    def start_game(self):
        # Start the game
        pass
```

player.py
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

location.py
```python
class Location:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

score.py
```python
class Score:
    def __init__(self):
        self.score = 0

    def add_score(self, points):
        self.score += points

    def get_score(self):
        return self.score
```

choice.py
```python
class Choice:
    def __init__(self, description, points):
        self.description = description
        self.points = points
```

requirements.txt
```
# No external libraries are used, so this file is empty
```

This is a basic structure of the game. The `start_game` method in the `Game` class will be filled with the game logic, which will involve presenting the player with choices and updating the score based on those choices. The `Player`, `Location`, and `Choice` classes will be expanded as needed to support the game logic.
