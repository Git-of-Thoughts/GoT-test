Based on your instructions, I'm going to create a simple Python application that prints a greeting message. The application will consist of two files: `main.py` which is the entry point of the application, and `greeting.py` which contains the logic for generating the greeting message.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It imports and uses the `Greeting` class from `greeting.py`.

2. `greeting.py`: This file contains the `Greeting` class. The `Greeting` class has a single method `generate_greeting` which returns a greeting message.

Now, let's write the code for each file:

main.py
```python
from greeting import Greeting

def main():
    # Create an instance of Greeting
    g = Greeting()

    # Generate a greeting message and print it
    print(g.generate_greeting())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

greeting.py
```python
class Greeting:
    def generate_greeting(self):
        return "Hello, world!"
```

The `main.py` file imports the `Greeting` class from `greeting.py`, creates an instance of `Greeting`, and calls its `generate_greeting` method to generate a greeting message. The generated message is then printed to the console.

The `greeting.py` file defines the `Greeting` class. The `Greeting` class has a single method `generate_greeting` which returns a greeting message.

This code should be fully functional as long as both `main.py` and `greeting.py` are in the same directory. To run the application, you can use the command `python main.py` in the terminal. The application should print "Hello, world!" to the console.
