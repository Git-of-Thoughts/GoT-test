The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the Python Snake Game are:

1. Class `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to initialize the snake, move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself or the walls.

2. Class `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have methods to initialize the food and randomly place the food on the game board.

3. Function `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will handle the game loop, user input, and game over conditions.

4. Function `draw_board`: This function will draw the game board, the snake, and the food.

5. Function `get_user_input`: This function will get the user input to control the direction of the snake.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

snake.py
```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.body = [(10, 10), (10, 11), (10, 12)]
        self.direction = "UP"

    def move(self):
        head = self.body[0]
        if self.direction == "UP":
            self.body = [(head[0]-1, head[1])] + self.body[:-1]
        elif self.direction == "DOWN":
            self.body = [(head[0]+1, head[1])] + self.body[:-1]
        elif self.direction == "LEFT":
            self.body = [(head[0], head[1]-1)] + self.body[:-1]
        elif self.direction == "RIGHT":
            self.body = [(head[0], head[1]+1)] + self.body[:-1]

    def grow(self):
        self.body.append(self.body[-1])

    def collided_with_self(self):
        return len(self.body) != len(set(self.body))

    def collided_with_wall(self, board_size):
        head = self.body[0]
        return head[0] < 0 or head[1] < 0 or head[0] >= board_size or head[1] >= board_size
```

food.py
```python
import random

class Food:
    def __init__(self, board_size):
        self.position = (random.randint(0, board_size-1), random.randint(0, board_size-1))

    def randomize_position(self, board_size):
        self.position = (random.randint(0, board_size-1), random.randint(0, board_size-1))
```

main.py
```python
from snake import Snake
from food import Food

def draw_board(snake, food, board_size):
    for i in range(board_size):
        for j in range(board_size):
            if (i, j) in snake.body:
                print("S", end="")
            elif (i, j) == food.position:
                print("F", end="")
            else:
                print(".", end="")
        print()

def get_user_input():
    direction = input("Enter direction (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT): ")
    return direction.upper()

def main():
    board_size = 20
    snake = Snake()
    food = Food(board_size)

    while True:
        draw_board(snake, food, board_size)
        direction = get_user_input()
        snake.direction = direction
        snake.move()

        if snake.collided_with_self() or snake.collided_with_wall(board_size):
            print("Game Over!")
            break

        if snake.body[0] == food.position:
            snake.grow()
            food.randomize_position(board_size)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that this is a very basic implementation of the snake game. It does not handle invalid user input and the game board does not refresh after each move. You may want to improve these aspects for a better user experience.
