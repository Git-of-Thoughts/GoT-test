Assumptions:
1. The game will be a simple text-based adventure game.
2. The game will be console-based.
3. The game will have a single player who will navigate through different rooms, picking up items and avoiding traps.
4. The game will end when the player reaches the final room or falls into a trap.
5. The game will be written in Python 3.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `Game`: This class will be the main driver of the game. It will handle the game loop and user input.
2. `Room`: This class will represent a room in the game. It will contain items and possibly a trap.
3. `Player`: This class will represent the player. It will keep track of the player's inventory and current room.
4. `Item`: This class will represent an item that the player can pick up.
5. `Trap`: This class will represent a trap that can end the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes.

game.py
```python
from player import Player
from room import Room

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = Player()
        self.rooms = self.create_rooms()
        self.current_room = self.rooms[0]

    def create_rooms(self):
        # Create rooms here
        pass

    def game_loop(self):
        # Handle game loop here
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game()
    game.game_loop()
```

player.py
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.inventory = []
        self.current_room = None

    def move(self, direction):
        # Handle player movement here
        pass

    def pick_up_item(self, item):
        # Handle picking up items here
        pass
```

room.py
```python
class Room:
    def __init__(self, description, items, trap):
        self.description = description
        self.items = items
        self.trap = trap

    def remove_item(self, item):
        # Remove item from room
        pass
```

item.py
```python
class Item:
    def __init__(self, name, description):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
```

trap.py
```python
class Trap:
    def __init__(self, description):
        self.description = description
```

requirements.txt
```txt
python==3.8.5
```

Please note that this is a very basic structure of the game. There are many features that could be added, such as different types of rooms and items, more complex traps, a health system for the player, etc.
