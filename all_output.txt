Based on your instructions, I'm going to create a simple Python application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This application will consist of two files: `main.py` (the entry point) and `greeting.py` (a module that contains the greeting logic).

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `Greeting` class: This class will be defined in `greeting.py` and will contain the logic for generating the greeting message.
2. `get_greeting` method: This method will be part of the `Greeting` class. It will return the greeting message.
3. `main` function: This function will be defined in `main.py`. It will create an instance of the `Greeting` class and print the greeting message to the console.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`greeting.py`
```python
class Greeting:
    """A class that generates a greeting message."""

    def get_greeting(self):
        """Returns a greeting message."""
        return "Hello, World!"
```

`main.py`
```python
from greeting import Greeting

def main():
    """The entry point of the application."""
    greeting = Greeting()
    print(greeting.get_greeting())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run this application, you would execute `main.py`. This would create an instance of the `Greeting` class and print "Hello, World!" to the console.

Please note that this is a very simple application. In a real-world scenario, the application might be much more complex and consist of many more files and classes. However, the basic principles would remain the same: define your classes and methods, make sure they are imported correctly, and ensure that your entry point calls the appropriate functions or methods.
