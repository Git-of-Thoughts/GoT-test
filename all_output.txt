The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this game are:

1. `Game` class: This class will handle the game logic.
   - `__init__`: Initializes the game.
   - `reset`: Resets the game.
   - `draw`: Draws the game board.
   - `move`: Moves the snake.
   - `collision_check`: Checks for collisions.
   - `food_check`: Checks if the snake has eaten food.
   - `run`: Runs the game.

2. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake.
   - `__init__`: Initializes the snake.
   - `get_head_position`: Returns the position of the snake's head.
   - `turn`: Turns the snake.
   - `move`: Moves the snake.
   - `reset`: Resets the snake.
   - `add_cube`: Adds a cube to the snake.

3. `Cube` class: This class will represent a cube (a unit of the snake's body or a piece of food).
   - `__init__`: Initializes the cube.
   - `move`: Moves the cube.
   - `draw`: Draws the cube.

4. `draw_grid` function: This function will draw the grid on the game board.

5. `random_snack` function: This function will generate a piece of food at a random position on the game board.

6. `message_box` function: This function will display a message box.

7. `main` function: This function will run the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

snake.py
```python
import math
import random
import pygame
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

class Cube(object):
    rows = 20
    w = 500
    def __init__(self, start, dirnx=1, dirny=0, color=(255,0,0)):
        pass

    def move(self, dirnx, dirny):
        pass

    def draw(self, surface, eyes=False):
        pass

class Snake(object):
    body = []
    turns = {}
    def __init__(self, color, pos):
        pass

    def move(self):
        pass

    def reset(self, pos):
        pass

    def addCube(self):
        pass

    def draw(self, surface):
        pass

def drawGrid(w, rows, surface):
    pass

def redrawWindow(surface):
    pass

def randomSnack(rows, item):
    pass

def message_box(subject, content):
    pass

def main():
    pass

rows = 
w = 
h = 

cube.rows = rows
cube.w = w

main()
```

This is a skeleton of the code. The functions and methods are currently empty and need to be filled in with the appropriate logic.
