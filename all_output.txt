The core classes and functions for the snake game will be:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, user input, and game over conditions.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Food`: This class will represent the food. It will have a method to place the food at a random location.
4. `Screen`: This class will handle the display of the game, including the snake, food, and score.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.

snake.py
```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.body = [(10, 10), (10, 11), (10, 12)]
        self.direction = "UP"

    def move(self):
        head = self.get_head()
        if self.direction == "UP":
            self.body.insert(0, (head[0] - 1, head[1]))
        elif self.direction == "DOWN":
            self.body.insert(0, (head[0] + 1, head[1]))
        elif self.direction == "LEFT":
            self.body.insert(0, (head[0], head[1] - 1))
        elif self.direction == "RIGHT":
            self.body.insert(0, (head[0], head[1] + 1))
        self.body.pop()

    def grow(self):
        self.body.append(self.body[-1])

    def get_head(self):
        return self.body[0]

    def has_collided_with_self(self):
        return self.get_head() in self.body[1:]
```

food.py
```python
import random

class Food:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = (0, 0)

    def place(self, snake_body):
        while True:
            x = random.randint(0, 19)
            y = random.randint(0, 19)
            if (x, y) not in snake_body:
                self.position = (x, y)
                break
```

screen.py
```python
class Screen:
    def __init__(self):
        self.score = 0

    def display(self, snake, food):
        for i in range(20):
            for j in range(20):
                if (i, j) in snake.body:
                    print("S", end="")
                elif (i, j) == food.position:
                    print("F", end="")
                else:
                    print(".", end="")
            print()
        print(f"Score: {self.score}")

    def increment_score(self):
        self.score += 1
```

game.py
```python
import time
from snake import Snake
from food import Food
from screen import Screen

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.food = Food()
        self.screen = Screen()
        self.food.place(self.snake.body)

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.screen.display(self.snake, self.food)
            self.snake.move()
            if self.snake.get_head() == self.food.position:
                self.snake.grow()
                self.screen.increment_score()
                self.food.place(self.snake.body)
            if self.snake.has_collided_with_self():
                break
            time.sleep(0.1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game()
    game.game_loop()
```

Please note that this is a simple implementation of the snake game and does not handle user input for controlling the snake's movement. You would need to use a library like `curses` or `pygame` to handle real-time user input in the console.
