The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the game are:

1. `Game` class: This class will handle the game logic, including the game loop, collision detection, and game over condition.
2. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake, including its current position, direction, and length.
3. `Food` class: This class will represent the food, including its current position.
4. `draw_board` function: This function will draw the current state of the game board.
5. `get_user_input` function: This function will get the user's input for the direction of the snake.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

snake.py
```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.length = 1
        self.direction = 'right'
        self.body = [(0, 0)]

    def move(self):
        head = self.body[0]
        if self.direction == 'right':
            new_head = (head[0], head[1] + 1)
        elif self.direction == 'left':
            new_head = (head[0], head[1] - 1)
        elif self.direction == 'up':
            new_head = (head[0] - 1, head[1])
        elif self.direction == 'down':
            new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])
        self.body.insert(0, new_head)
        if len(self.body) > self.length:
            self.body.pop()

    def change_direction(self, direction):
        self.direction = direction

    def get_head(self):
        return self.body[0]

    def get_body(self):
        return self.body[1:]
```

food.py
```python
import random

class Food:
    def __init__(self, board_size):
        self.position = self.generate_food(board_size)

    def generate_food(self, board_size):
        return (random.randint(0, board_size - 1), random.randint(0, board_size - 1))

    def get_position(self):
        return self.position
```

game.py
```python
from snake import Snake
from food import Food

class Game:
    def __init__(self, board_size):
        self.board_size = board_size
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.food = Food(board_size)

    def is_game_over(self):
        head = self.snake.get_head()
        return (head in self.snake.get_body()) or (head[0] < 0 or head[0] >= self.board_size or head[1] < 0 or head[1] >= self.board_size)

    def update(self, direction):
        self.snake.change_direction(direction)
        self.snake.move()
        if self.snake.get_head() == self.food.get_position():
            self.snake.length += 1
            self.food = Food(self.board_size)
```

main.py
```python
from game import Game

def draw_board(game):
    for i in range(game.board_size):
        for j in range(game.board_size):
            if (i, j) in game.snake.get_body():
                print('S', end='')
            elif (i, j) == game.snake.get_head():
                print('H', end='')
            elif (i, j) == game.food.get_position():

            else:
                print('.', end='')
        print()

def get_user_input():
    direction = input('Enter direction (up, down, left, right): ')
    return direction

def main():
    game = Game(10)
    while not game.is_game_over():
        draw_board(game)
        direction = get_user_input()
        game.update(direction)
    print('Game over!')

if __name__ == '__main__':

This game is a simple text-based snake game. The game board is a 10x10 grid. The snake is represented by 'S' and its head by 'H', the food is represented by 'F', and empty spaces are represented by '.'. The user is prompted to enter a direction for the snake to move. The game ends when the snake hits the border or itself.
