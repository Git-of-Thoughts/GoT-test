Assumptions:
1. The game will be a simple text-based adventure game.
2. The complexity level will be beginner.
3. The game mechanics will include a scoring system based on the player's decisions.
4. The target audience will be all ages.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `Game` class: This will be the main class that controls the game flow.
2. `start_game` method: This method will start the game.
3. `Player` class: This class will represent the player.
4. `Location` class: This class will represent the different locations in the game.
5. `Choice` class: This class will represent the different choices a player can make.
6. `calculate_score` function: This function will calculate the player's score based on their choices.

Now, let's write the code for each class and function.

game.py
```python
from player import Player
from location import Location

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = Player()
        self.locations = self.create_locations()

    def create_locations(self):
        # Create locations here
        pass

    def start_game(self):
        # Start game here
        pass
```

player.py
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.score = 0
        self.current_location = None

    def make_choice(self, choice):
        # Make choice here
        pass
```

location.py
```python
class Location:
    def __init__(self, name, choices):
        self.name = name
        self.choices = choices
```

choice.py
```python
class Choice:
    def __init__(self, description, score):
        self.description = description
        self.score = score
```

calculate_score.py
```python
def calculate_score(player, choice):
    player.score += choice.score
```

This is a very basic structure of the game. The `Game` class controls the game flow, the `Player` class represents the player, the `Location` class represents the different locations in the game, the `Choice` class represents the different choices a player can make, and the `calculate_score` function calculates the player's score based on their choices. The game starts when the `start_game` method of the `Game` class is called.
