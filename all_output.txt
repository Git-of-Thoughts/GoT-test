Assumptions:

1. The game will be a simple screen tapping game where the user taps on a button as many times as possible within a certain time limit.
2. The web app will have a simple layout with a button for the game, a timer, and a score display.
3. The technology stack will be Python for the backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and SQLite for the database.
4. The ranking system will rank users based on the number of taps they made within the time limit. The ranking will be displayed per country.
5. The countries included in the ranking will be all countries in the world.
6. The database will store the user's IP, score, and country.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:

1. Game: This class will handle the game logic such as starting the game, ending the game, and updating the score.
2. User: This class will represent a user playing the game. It will have methods to get the user's IP and country.
3. Database: This class will handle all interactions with the database such as saving a score and getting the ranking.
4. get_country(ip): This function will return the country based on the IP.
5. update_score(user, score): This function will update the user's score in the database.
6. get_ranking(country): This function will return the ranking for a specific country.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, which is the main.py file.

main.py
```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template
from game import Game
from user import User
from database import Database

app = Flask(__name__)
game = Game()
db = Database()

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        score = request.form.get('score')
        ip = request.remote_addr
        user = User(ip)
        db.update_score(user, score)
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/ranking/<country>')
def ranking(country):
    ranking = db.get_ranking(country)
    return render_template('ranking.html', ranking=ranking)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

game.py
```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.score = 0

    def start(self):
        self.score = 0

    def tap(self):
        self.score += 1

    def end(self):
        return self.score
```

user.py
```python
import requests

class User:
    def __init__(self, ip):
        self.ip = ip
        self.country = self.get_country()

    def get_country(self):
        response = requests.get(f'https://ipinfo.io/{self.ip}/country')
        return response.text.strip()
```

database.py
```python
import sqlite3

class Database:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect('game.db')
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        self.cursor.execute('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS scores (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                ip TEXT,
                country TEXT,
                score INTEGER
            )
        ''')

    def update_score(self, user, score):
        self.cursor.execute('''
            INSERT INTO scores (ip, country, score)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
        ''', (user.ip, user.country, score))
        self.conn.commit()

    def get_ranking(self, country):
        self.cursor.execute('''
            SELECT * FROM scores
            WHERE country = ?
            ORDER BY score DESC
        ''', (country,))
        return self.cursor.fetchall()
```
