The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain methods to start the game, handle user input, update the game state, and render the game state to the console.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will contain methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Apple`: This class will represent the apple. It will contain a method to place the apple at a random location on the grid.
4. `Point`: This class will represent a point on the grid. It will contain x and y coordinates.

Now, let's write the code for each class in separate files.

game.py
```python
import random
from snake import Snake
from apple import Apple

class Game:
    def __init__(self, width=20, height=20):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.apple = Apple(self.width, self.height)

    def start(self):
        while True:
            self.snake.move()
            if self.snake.head == self.apple.position:
                self.snake.grow()
                self.apple = Apple(self.width, self.height)
            elif (self.snake.head.x < 0 or self.snake.head.y < 0 or
                  self.snake.head.x >= self.width or self.snake.head.y >= self.height or
                  self.snake.head in self.snake.body):
                break
            self.render()

    def render(self):
        for y in range(self.height):
            for x in range(self.width):
                if self.snake.head.x == x and self.snake.head.y == y:
                    print('S', end='')
                elif self.apple.position.x == x and self.apple.position.y == y:
                    print('A', end='')
                elif any(point.x == x and point.y == y for point in self.snake.body):
                    print('s', end='')
                else:
                    print('.', end='')
            print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Game().start()
```

snake.py
```python
from point import Point

class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.direction = Point(1, 0)
        self.head = Point(0, 0)
        self.body = []

    def move(self):
        self.body.insert(0, self.head)
        self.head += self.direction
        self.body.pop()

    def grow(self):
        self.body.insert(0, self.head)
        self.head += self.direction
```

apple.py
```python
import random
from point import Point

class Apple:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.position = Point(random.randint(0, width-1), random.randint(0, height-1))
```

point.py
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
```

Please note that this is a very basic implementation of the snake game. It doesn't handle user input, so the snake will just move in a straight line until it hits the wall. Also, the game doesn't keep score. These features could be added in a more advanced version of the game.
