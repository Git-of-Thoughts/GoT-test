Given the assumptions, we will be developing this game using Python and the Pygame library. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides functionalities such as drawing on the screen and handling events (like key presses and mouse movements).

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `Bird`: This class will represent the bird character in the game. It will have methods for flapping (rising up), falling, and checking for collisions.

2. `Pipe`: This class will represent the obstacles that the bird has to navigate through. It will have methods for moving the pipes and checking for collisions with the bird.

3. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will have methods for starting the game, handling events (like the player tapping the screen), updating the game state, and drawing the game state on the screen.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game loop.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.

main.py
```python
import pygame
from game import Game

def main():
    pygame.init()
    game = Game()
    game.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

game.py
```python
import pygame
from bird import Bird
from pipe import Pipe

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        self.bird = Bird()
        self.pipes = [Pipe()]

    def run(self):
        running = True
        while running:
            self.clock.tick(60)
            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    running = False
                elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
                    self.bird.flap()
            self.update()
            self.draw()
        pygame.quit()

    def update(self):
        self.bird.update()
        for pipe in self.pipes:
            pipe.update()
            if pipe.collides_with(self.bird):
                self.game_over()

    def draw(self):
        self.screen.fill((255, 255, 255))
        self.bird.draw(self.screen)
        for pipe in self.pipes:
            pipe.draw(self.screen)
        pygame.display.flip()

    def game_over(self):
        print("Game Over!")
        pygame.quit()
```

bird.py
```python
import pygame

class Bird:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 100
        self.y = 300
        self.velocity = 0

    def flap(self):
        self.velocity = -10

    def update(self):
        self.velocity += 1
        self.y += self.velocity

    def draw(self, screen):
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 0, 0), (self.x, self.y), 20)

    def collides_with(self, pipe):
        return pipe.x < self.x < pipe.x + pipe.width and pipe.y < self.y < pipe.y + pipe.height
```

pipe.py
```python
import pygame
import random

class Pipe:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 800
        self.y = random.randint(100, 500)
        self.width = 100
        self.height = random.randint(100, 300)
        self.velocity = -5

    def update(self):
        self.x += self.velocity

    def draw(self, screen):
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0, 255, 0), (self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height))

    def collides_with(self, bird):
        return bird.x < self.x < bird.x + bird.width and bird.y < bird.y < bird.y + bird.height
```

To run the game, you would first install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the game using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```
