Given the assumptions, we will need two files:

1. `server.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will contain a simple Flask server that serves our webpage. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML file that will be served by our Flask server. It contains the greeting message.

Let's start with the `server.py` file:

server.py
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    # This function will be called when the user navigates to the home page.
    # It will render the index.html template.
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # This will start the server if the script is run directly.
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Next, let's create the `index.html` file:

templates/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, welcome to our webpage!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Finally, we need to create a `requirements.txt` file to specify the dependencies of our project:

requirements.txt
```txt
Flask==1.1.2
```

To run the server, you would first install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then run the server with `python server.py`. The webpage will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
