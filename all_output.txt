The project will be a simple text-based adventure game. The player will be able to move between rooms, pick up items, and use items. The game will end when the player reaches the final room.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `Room`: This class will represent a room in the game. It will have properties for the room's description, the items in the room, and the rooms that can be reached from this room.
2. `Player`: This class will represent the player. It will have properties for the player's current room and the items the player is carrying.
3. `Item`: This class will represent an item that the player can pick up.
4. `main`: This function will be the entry point for the game. It will create the game world and start the game loop.
5. `game_loop`: This function will handle the main game loop. It will prompt the player for input and handle the player's actions.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

main.ml
```ocaml
open Room
open Player

let main () =
  let room1 = Room.create "You are in a small room. There is a door to the north." [] in
  let room2 = Room.create "You are in a large room. There is a door to the south." [] in
  Room.add_exit room1 "north" room2;
  Room.add_exit room2 "south" room1;
  let player = Player.create room1 in
  game_loop player

let () = main ()
```

room.ml
```ocaml
type t = {
  description : string;
  mutable items : Item.t list;
  mutable exits : (string * t) list;
}

let create description items = { description; items; exits = [] }

let add_exit room direction room' =
  room.exits <- (direction, room') :: room.exits
```

player.ml
```ocaml
type t = {
  mutable current_room : Room.t;
  mutable inventory : Item.t list;
}

let create current_room = { current_room; inventory = [] }

let move player direction =
  match List.assoc_opt direction player.current_room.Room.exits with
  | Some room -> player.current_room <- room
  | None -> print_endline "You can't go that way."

let pick_up player item =
  if List.mem item player.current_room.Room.items then begin
    player.current_room.Room.items <- List.filter ((<>) item) player.current_room.Room.items;
    player.inventory <- item :: player.inventory;
    print_endline ("You picked up the " ^ item.Item.name ^ ".")
  end else
    print_endline "That item is not here."
```

item.ml
```ocaml
type t = {
  name : string;
  description : string;
}

let create name description = { name; description }
```

game_loop.ml
```ocaml
let rec game_loop player =
  print_endline player.Player.current_room.Room.description;
  print_string "> ";
  match read_line () with
  | "quit" -> ()
  | command -> handle_command player command; game_loop player

and handle_command player command =
  match String.split_on_char ' ' command with
  | "go" :: direction :: _ -> Player.move player direction
  | "get" :: item_name :: _ ->
    let item = List.find_opt (fun item -> item.Item.name = item_name) player.Player.current_room.Room.items in
    (match item with
     | Some item -> Player.pick_up player item
     | None -> print_endline "That item is not here.")
  | _ -> print_endline "I don't understand that command."
```

This code should be placed in separate files named `main.ml`, `room.ml`, `player.ml`, `item.ml`, and `game_loop.ml`. The `main.ml` file is the entry point for the game. The `room.ml`, `player.ml`, and `item.ml` files define the `Room`, `Player`, and `Item` classes, respectively. The `game_loop.ml` file defines the main game loop and the function for handling player commands.
