The core classes and functions necessary for the snake game are:

1. `Game`: This class will represent the game itself. It will contain methods to start the game, handle game over, and update the game state.
2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake. It will contain methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.
3. `Food`: This class will represent the food. It will contain a method to place the food at a random location within the game area.

Now, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.

main.py
```python
import curses
from game import Game

def main(stdscr):
    # Initialize the game
    game = Game(stdscr)
    # Start the game
    game.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    curses.wrapper(main)
```

Next, let's define the `Game` class in `game.py`.

game.py
```python
import curses
from snake import Snake
from food import Food

class Game:
    def __init__(self, stdscr):
        self.stdscr = stdscr
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.food = Food()

    def start(self):
        # Game loop
        while True:
            self.stdscr.clear()
            self.snake.move()
            self.food.place()
            self.stdscr.refresh()

    def game_over(self):
        # End the game
        pass

    def update(self):
        # Update the game state
        pass
```

Next, let's define the `Snake` class in `snake.py`.

snake.py
```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.body = [(0, 0)]
        self.direction = "RIGHT"

    def move(self):
        # Move the snake in the current direction
        pass

    def grow(self):
        # Grow the snake
        pass

    def check_collision(self):
        # Check if the snake has collided with itself
        pass
```

Finally, let's define the `Food` class in `food.py`.

food.py
```python
class Food:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = (0, 0)

    def place(self):
        # Place the food at a random location
        pass
```

Please note that the code is not yet fully functional. The methods in the `Game`, `Snake`, and `Food` classes are currently placeholders and need to be implemented.
