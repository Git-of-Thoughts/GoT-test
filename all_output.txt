Assumptions:

1. The game will be a simple console-based snake game.
2. The snake will move in a grid layout.
3. The snake will start at a random position in the grid.
4. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
5. A piece of food will appear in a random position in the grid.
6. When the snake eats the food, the length of the snake increases by one unit.
7. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body.
8. The game will run on any platform that supports Python.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. Class `Game`: This will be the main class that controls the game logic.
   - Method `__init__`: Initializes the game.
   - Method `start`: Starts the game.
   - Method `end`: Ends the game.
   - Method `generate_food`: Generates food at a random position in the grid.
   - Method `update`: Updates the game state.

2. Class `Snake`: This class represents the snake.
   - Method `__init__`: Initializes the snake.
   - Method `move`: Moves the snake in a given direction.
   - Method `grow`: Increases the length of the snake.
   - Method `check_collision`: Checks if the snake has collided with the wall or itself.

3. Class `Grid`: This class represents the grid.
   - Method `__init__`: Initializes the grid.
   - Method `draw`: Draws the grid.

4. Function `main`: This is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the `Game` class and starts the game.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and functions.

game.py
```python
import random
from snake import Snake
from grid import Grid

class Game:
    def __init__(self, grid_size):
        self.grid = Grid(grid_size)
        self.snake = Snake(self.grid)
        self.food = None
        self.generate_food()

    def start(self):
        while True:
            self.update()

    def end(self):
        print("Game Over!")
        exit(0)

    def generate_food(self):
        while True:
            position = (random.randint(0, self.grid.size - 1), random.randint(0, self.grid.size - 1))
            if position not in self.snake.body:
                self.food = position
                break

    def update(self):
        self.snake.move()
        if self.snake.head == self.food:
            self.snake.grow()
            self.generate_food()
        elif self.snake.check_collision():
            self.end()
        self.grid.draw(self.snake, self.food)

def main():
    game = Game(10)
    game.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

snake.py
```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self, grid):
        self.grid = grid
        self.direction = "right"
        self.body = [(0, 0)]
        self.head = self.body[0]

    def move(self):
        if self.direction == "up":
            self.head = (self.head[0] - 1, self.head[1])
        elif self.direction == "down":
            self.head = (self.head[0] + 1, self.head[1])
        elif self.direction == "left":
            self.head = (self.head[0], self.head[1] - 1)
        elif self.direction == "right":
            self.head = (self.head[0], self.head[1] + 1)
        self.body.insert(0, self.head)

    def grow(self):
        pass

    def check_collision(self):
        return self.head in self.body[1:] or not (0 <= self.head[0] < self.grid.size and 0 <= self.head[1] < self.grid.size)
```

grid.py
```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size

    def draw(self, snake, food):
        for i in range(self.size):
            for j in range(self.size):
                if (i, j) in snake.body:
                    print("S", end="")
                elif (i, j) == food:
                    print("F", end="")
                else:
                    print(".", end="")
            print()
        print()
```

Please note that this is a very basic implementation of the snake game. There are many ways to improve this code, such as adding user input to control the snake's direction, increasing the speed of the snake as it grows, adding a score system, etc.
