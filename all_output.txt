Based on the assumptions and the requirements, we will create a Python application that will allow Polycarp to manipulate and analyze binary words. The application will have the following core classes and functions:

1. `BinaryWord`: This class will represent a binary word. It will have methods to validate the binary word, count the number of 0s and 1s, and perform other operations.

2. `BinaryWordAnalyzer`: This class will be used to analyze a list of binary words. It will have methods to find the binary word with the most 0s, the most 1s, and other analysis functions.

3. `main.py`: This will be the entry point of the application. It will use the `BinaryWord` and `BinaryWordAnalyzer` classes to perform operations on the binary words.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

`binary_word.py`
```python
class BinaryWord:
    def __init__(self, word):
        self.word = word

    def validate(self):
        if not all(c in '01' for c in self.word):
            raise ValueError(f"{self.word} is not a valid binary word")

    def count_zeros(self):
        return self.word.count('0')

    def count_ones(self):
        return self.word.count('1')
```

`binary_word_analyzer.py`
```python
class BinaryWordAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, words):
        self.words = words

    def find_most_zeros(self):
        return max(self.words, key=lambda word: word.count_zeros())

    def find_most_ones(self):
        return max(self.words, key=lambda word: word.count_ones())
```

`main.py`
```python
from binary_word import BinaryWord
from binary_word_analyzer import BinaryWordAnalyzer

def main():
    words = [BinaryWord(word) for word in input().split()]
    analyzer = BinaryWordAnalyzer(words)

    print("Binary word with most zeros:", analyzer.find_most_zeros().word)
    print("Binary word with most ones:", analyzer.find_most_ones().word)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

`requirements.txt`
```
# No external dependencies
```

This application will read a list of binary words from the standard input, create `BinaryWord` objects for each word, and then use the `BinaryWordAnalyzer` to find and print the binary word with the most 0s and the one with the most 1s.
