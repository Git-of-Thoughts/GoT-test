The boss requires a system that can extract the latest technology news from the donews platform and send it to the email address cqtxh@163.com. The system should be developed in the role of an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Develop a system that can efficiently extract the latest technology news from the donews platform",
    "Ensure the system can automatically send the extracted news to the specified email address",
    "Ensure the system is reliable and can handle potential errors or exceptions"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As an engineer, I want to develop a system that can automatically extract the latest technology news from the donews platform",
    "As an engineer, I want the system to send the extracted news to the specified email address automatically",
    "As a user, I want to receive the latest technology news in my email without manually checking the donews platform",
    "As a user, I want the system to be reliable and not miss any important news updates",
    "As a user, I want the system to handle potential errors or exceptions and notify me if there are any issues"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Google Alerts: Allows users to monitor the web for interesting new content based on their preferences",
    "Feedly: A news aggregator application that compiles news feeds from a variety of online sources",
    "NewsBlur: An RSS news reader with direct integration with various social networks",

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a system that can automatically extract the latest technology news from the donews platform and send it to a specified email address. The system should be reliable and able to handle potential errors or exceptions.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Develop a news extraction module that can pull the latest technology news from the donews platform", "P0"),

## UI Design draft
The system will be a command-line based application. The main interface will display the status of the system, including the last extraction time, the number of news items extracted, and the last email sent time. The system will also display any errors or exceptions that occur during the extraction or email sending process.

The system will be implemented as a Python script that uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping and smtplib for sending emails. The script will be scheduled to run at regular intervals using the schedule library.

If any errors or exceptions occur during the process, they will be logged using the logging library and the user will be notified.
