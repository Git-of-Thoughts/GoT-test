The boss has tasked us with designing the software for a fun snake game in Python. The game should be coded by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create an engaging and fun snake game",
    "Ensure the game is easy to understand and play",
    "Design the game with a clean and appealing user interface"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to easily start a new game so that I can play whenever I want",
    "As a user, I want the game to have smooth controls so that I can effectively control the snake",
    "As a user, I want to see my score while playing so that I can track my progress",
    "As a user, I want the game to become progressively harder so that I am constantly challenged",
    "As a user, I want the game to have a clean and appealing interface so that my gaming experience is enjoyable"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Python Snake Game: Simple, easy to play, lacks a visually appealing interface",
    "Slither.io: Multiplayer, visually appealing, but not coded in Python",
    "Nokia Snake Xenzia: Classic, nostalgic, but lacks modern design elements",

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a fun and engaging snake game coded in Python. It should have a clean and appealing user interface, easy controls, and a scoring system. The game should also become progressively harder to keep the user engaged.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Design the game with a clean and appealing user interface", "P0"),
    ("Implement smooth controls for the snake", "P0"),
    ("Include a scoring system to track progress", "P0"),
    ("Ensure the game becomes progressively harder", "P1"),
    ("Allow the user to easily start a new game", "P0")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The game will have a simple and clean design with a focus on usability. The main screen will display the game area, the current score, and a 'New Game' button. The snake will be controlled using the arrow keys. The game area will be a grid where the snake moves, and the score will be displayed at the top of the screen.

2023-08-28 18:10:57.148 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
We will be using the Pygame library, an open-source module for Python designed for video game creation. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries. Pygame is highly portable and runs on almost every platform and operating system. We will also use the os and random libraries that come with Python. The os library will be used to center the game window on the user's screen, and the random library will be used to generate random positions for the food in the game.

The main challenges in the implementation would be handling the game logic like the movement of the snake, collision detection with the food and the boundaries, and increasing the speed of the snake as the game progresses. Pygame provides good support for handling these.

## Python package name
```python
"snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game{
        +int score
        +int speed
        +bool game_over
        +start_game()
        +end_game()
        +increase_speed()
        +update_score()

        +generate()

We will also use the os and random libraries that come with Python. The os library will be used to center the game window on the user's screen, and the random library will be used to generate random positions for the food in the game.\n\nThe main challenges in the implementation would be handling the game logic like the movement of the snake, collision detection with the food and the boundaries, and increasing the speed of the snake as the game progresses.
