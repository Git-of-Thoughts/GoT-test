The boss has requested for the design of a content website for architects. The website should be similar to Pinterest with images generated by AIGC. The code for the website should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a user-friendly content website for architects",
    "Incorporate AIGC-generated images into the website",
    "Ensure the website is similar in functionality and design to Pinterest"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As an architect, I want to browse through a variety of AIGC-generated images to find inspiration for my projects",
    "As a user, I want to be able to save images I like to my personal board for future reference",
    "As a user, I want to be able to search for specific types of architectural designs",
    "As a user, I want to be able to upload my own images and share them with the community",
    "As a user, I want to interact with other users by commenting on and liking their posts"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Pinterest: A well-known platform for sharing and discovering new ideas. It has a user-friendly interface and a large user base, but it doesn't focus specifically on architecture",
    "ArchDaily: A website dedicated to architecture, but it lacks the social and interactive aspects of Pinterest",
    "Houzz: A platform for home renovation and design, providing a unique blend of products, pros, and inspiration. However, it's more focused on interior design than architecture",
    "Dwell: A platform for discovering modern architecture and design, but it doesn't allow users to upload their own content",
    "Architizer: A platform for architects to showcase their work, but it lacks the user-friendly interface of Pinterest",
    "Designboom: An online architecture magazine, but it doesn't have the interactive features of a social platform",

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a content website for architects, similar to Pinterest. It should allow users to browse, save, and upload images, as well as interact with other users. The images on the website should be generated by AIGC.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement a user-friendly interface similar to Pinterest", "P0"),

    ("Enable users to upload their own images and share them with the community", "P1"),
    ("Include interactive features for users to comment on and like posts", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The website should have a clean, minimalist design with a focus on the images. The homepage should display a grid of images, with options to filter and sort them. Each image should have a button to save it to the user's personal board. There should also be a search bar at the top of the page for users to find specific types of designs. The user's personal board and uploaded images should be accessible from a menu bar at the top of the page.

2023-09-12 03:31:27.413 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
The website will be built using the Django framework due to its robustness and scalability. Django has a user-friendly admin interface which can be used for managing the content of the website. For the front-end, we will use Bootstrap to achieve a responsive and user-friendly interface similar to Pinterest. 

To incorporate AIGC-generated images, we will use an open-source AI image generation library such as DeepArt or DeepDream. These images will be stored in a PostgreSQL database due to its excellent performance with large datasets. 

For user interactions such as saving images, commenting, and liking posts, we will use Django's built-in authentication and authorization modules. 

The search functionality will be implemented using Elasticsearch, an open-source search engine that provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant I as Image
    participant C as Comment
    participant L as Like
    U->>I: save_image(image)
    U->>I: upload_image(image)
    U->>C: comment_on_image(image, comment)
    U->>L: like_image(image)
    I->>C: add_comment(comment)
    I->>L: add_like(like)
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
