The boss has requested a fun snake game to be developed in Python.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a simple yet engaging snake game using Python",
    "Ensure the game is user-friendly and intuitive",
    "Incorporate a scoring system to increase competitiveness"
]
```

## User Stories

[
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate the snake so that I can play the game without confusion",
    "As a user, I want to see my score while playing so that I can track my progress",
    "As a user, I want the game to increase in difficulty as my score increases so that the game remains challenging",
    "As a user, I want to be able to restart the game quickly after losing so that I can try to beat my score",
    "As a user, I want the game to have a visually appealing interface so that my gaming experience is enjoyable"
]

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a simple, engaging, and user-friendly snake game developed in Python. It should include a scoring system and the difficulty should increase as the user's score increases. The game should also have a visually appealing interface.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Develop the basic functionality of the snake game (snake movement, food spawning, collision detection)", "P0"),
    ("Implement a scoring system that increases as the snake eats food", "P0"),
    ("Increase the speed of the snake as the score increases to add difficulty", "P1"),
    ("Design a simple and visually appealing user interface", "P1"),
    ("Add a 'restart game' feature that allows users to quickly start a new game", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The game will have a simple 2D interface. The snake will be represented as a line that grows in length as it eats food. The food will be represented as small dots that appear randomly on the screen. The score will be displayed at the top of the screen. The game will have a 'start/restart' button and a 'quit' button.

## Anything UNCLEAR

2023-08-24 02:02:31.843 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
We will use the Pygame library, an open-source Python library designed for making video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries. Pygame is highly portable and runs on almost every platform and operating system. 

The game will be divided into three main parts: 
1. Game Initialization: This is where we will initialize the Pygame library, define game variables, and create the game window.
2. Game Loop: This is the main loop where all the action happens. It includes event handling (like checking for key presses), updating the game state (like moving the snake and checking for collisions), and rendering the game state to the screen.
3. Game Over: This is where we will handle the end of the game, display the final score, and provide an option to restart the game.

The game will be developed in an object-oriented manner, with separate classes for the Snake, Food, and Game.

Game Initialization: This is where we will initialize the Pygame library, define game variables, and create the game window.\n2. Game Loop: This is the main loop where all the action happens. It includes event handling (like checking for key presses), updating the game state (like moving the snake and checking for collisions), and rendering the game state to the screen.\n3. Game Over: This is where we will handle the end of the game, display the final score, and provide an option to restart the game.\n\nThe game will be developed in an object-oriented manner, with separate classes for the Snake, Food, and Game.', 'Python package name': '"snake_game"\n', 'File list': ['main.py', 'snake.py', 'food.py', 'game.py'], 'Data structures and interface definitions': 'classDiagram\n    class Snake{\n        +list body\n        +str direction\n        +move()\n        +grow()\n    }\n    class Food{\n        +tuple position\n        +respawn()\n    }\n    class Game{\n        +Snake snake\n        +Food food\n        +int score\n        +bool game_over\n        +start_game()\n        +end_game()\n        +update_game_state()\n        +render_game_state()\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Food: has\n', 'Program call flow': 'sequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    M->>G: start_game()\n    loop Game Loop\n        G->>S: move()\n        G->>G: update_game_state()\n        G->>G: render_game_state()\n        Note over G: Check for game over\n    end\n    G->>M: end_game()\n', 'Anything UNCLEAR': 'The requirement is clear to me.'}
