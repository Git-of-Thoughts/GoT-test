The boss has tasked us with designing a software for a fun snake game in Python.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a fun and engaging snake game using Python",
    "Ensure the game is easy to understand and play",
    "Design a visually appealing and intuitive user interface"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily start a new game so that I can play whenever I want",
    "As a user, I want the game to have clear rules so that I can understand how to play",
    "As a user, I want to be able to pause and resume the game so that I can take breaks",
    "As a user, I want the game to keep track of my high scores so that I can challenge myself to beat them",
    "As a user, I want the game to have a visually appealing interface so that my gaming experience is enjoyable"
]

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Python Snake Game: A simple, text-based snake game. Our product can stand out by offering a more visually appealing interface and additional features like pausing and resuming the game",
    "Pygame Snake: This game has a more advanced interface, but the controls can be confusing. Our product should focus on simplicity and ease of use",

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a snake game developed in Python. It should be fun, engaging, and easy to play. The game should have a visually appealing interface and features like starting a new game, pausing and resuming the game, and keeping track of high scores.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[

## UI Design draft
The game will have a simple, clean, and colorful interface. The main screen will have options to start a new game, view high scores, and exit the game. The game screen will display the snake, food, and the current score. The game will be controlled using the arrow keys.

2023-08-24 02:12:25.314 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
We will use the Pygame open-source library to create the snake game. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games and provides the functionality needed for our game such as handling events, drawing graphics, and updating the game state. The difficult points of the requirements include designing the game logic for snake movement and food consumption, creating a visually appealing and intuitive user interface, and implementing a system to keep track of high scores. We will tackle these challenges by dividing the tasks into smaller, manageable parts and developing them iteratively.

## Python package name
```python
"snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "scoreboard.py"
]
```

Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games and provides the functionality needed for our game such as handling events, drawing graphics, and updating the game state. The difficult points of the requirements include designing the game logic for snake movement and food consumption, creating a visually appealing and intuitive user interface, and implementing a system to keep track of high scores. We will tackle these challenges by dividing the tasks into smaller, manageable parts and developing them iteratively.', 'Python package name': '"snake_game"\n', 'File list': ['main.py', 'game.py', 'snake.py', 'food.py', 'scoreboard.py'], 'Data structures and interface definitions': 'classDiagram\n    class Game{\n        +start_game()\n        +pause_game()\n        +resume_game()\n        +end_game()\n    }\n    class Snake{\n        +move()\n        +eat(Food)\n        +grow()\n        +die()\n    }\n    class Food{\n        +generate()\n    }\n    class ScoreBoard{\n        +update_score(int)\n        +reset_score()\n        +get_high_score(): int\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls\n    Game "1" -- "1" Food: controls\n    Game "1" -- "1" ScoreBoard: controls\n    Snake "1" -- "0..1" Food: eats\n', 'Program call flow': 'sequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    participant SB as ScoreBoard\n    M->>G: start_game()\n    G->>S: move()\n    G->>F: generate()\n    S->>F: eat(F)\n    alt if Snake eats Food\n        G->>S: grow()\n        G->>SB: update_score(1)\n    else if Snake hits boundary or itself\n        G->>S: die()\n        G->>G: end_game()\n    end\n', 'Anything UNCLEAR': 'The requirement is clear to me.'}
