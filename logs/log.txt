The boss has tasked me with designing the software for a fun snake game in Python. The code should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a fun and engaging snake game in Python",

    "Design the game to be visually appealing"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily start a new game so I can play whenever I want",
    "As a user, I want the game to be challenging so that I am engaged and entertained",
    "As a user, I want to be able to see my high score so I can track my progress",
    "As a user, I want the game to have a visually appealing design so I enjoy playing",

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a fun and engaging snake game designed in Python. It should be easy to understand and play, visually appealing, and run smoothly without any glitches or lags. The game should also allow users to see their high scores to track their progress.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[

## UI Design draft
The game should have a simple and clean user interface. The main screen should display the game area, the current score, and the high score. The game area should be a grid where the snake moves. The snake and the food item should be distinct and easy to identify. The design should be colorful and visually appealing to engage users.

We will be using the Pygame library, an open-source module for Python, to create the snake game. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games which provides functionalities such as drawing on the screen, handling keyboard and mouse events, playing sounds, and more. The game will have a Game class which will handle the game logic, a Snake class which will handle the snake's movement and growth, and a Food class to handle the placement of food in the game. The game's difficulty level can be adjusted by increasing the speed of the snake.

Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games which provides functionalities such as drawing on the screen, handling keyboard and mouse events, playing sounds, and more. The game will have a Game class which will handle the game logic, a Snake class which will handle the snake's movement and growth, and a Food class to handle the placement of food in the game. The game's difficulty level can be adjusted by increasing the speed of the snake.", 'Python package name': '"snake_game"\n', 'File list': ['main.py', 'game.py', 'snake.py', 'food.py', 'constants.py'], 'Data structures and interface definitions': 'classDiagram\n    class Game{\n        -int score\n        -int high_score\n        -Snake snake\n        -Food food\n        +__init__(self)\n        +run(self)\n        +reset(self)\n        +update_score(self)\n        +draw(self)\n    }\n    class Snake{\n        -list body\n        -str direction\n        +__init__(self)\n        +move(self)\n        +grow(self)\n        +draw(self)\n    }\n    class Food{\n        -tuple position\n        +__init__(self)\n        +reposition(self)\n        +draw(self)\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: has\n    Game "1" -- "1" Food: has\n', 'Program call flow': 'sequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    M->>G: create game\n    G->>S: create snake\n    G->>F: create food\n    loop game loop\n        G->>G: run\n        G->>S: move snake\n        alt if snake eats food\n            G->>S: grow snake\n            G->>F: reposition food\n            G->>G: update score\n        end\n        G->>G: draw\n        alt if game over\n            G->>G: reset\n        end\n    end\n', 'Anything UNCLEAR': 'The requirement is clear to me.'}
