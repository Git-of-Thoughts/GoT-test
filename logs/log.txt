The boss has asked to design the software of a fun snake game in Python. The code for the game should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a fun, engaging and easy to play snake game in Python",
    "Ensure the game is lightweight and runs smoothly",
    "Incorporate user-friendly design and intuitive controls"
]
```

## User Stories

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a fun and engaging snake game developed in Python. It should have user-friendly controls and run smoothly. The game should also be challenging and allow users to track their high scores.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Develop the basic game mechanics including snake movement and growth", "P0"),
    ("Implement a scoring system to track user's high scores", "P0"),

```

## UI Design draft
The game will have a simple and clean interface. The main screen will display the game area where the snake moves. The snake will be controlled using the arrow keys. The current score will be displayed at the top of the screen. There will be a pause button at the bottom of the screen. The game will have a retro design aesthetic with bright colors to make it visually appealing.

2023-09-02 02:21:48.965 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
We will use the Pygame library, an open-source Python library designed for making video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries. Pygame is highly portable and runs on almost every platform and operating system. It will allow us to easily handle user inputs, draw graphics, and manage timing for the game. We will also use the Pygame GUI library for creating user interfaces. 

The main challenge will be implementing the game logic for the snake's movement and growth, collision detection, and scoring system. We will need to ensure that the game runs smoothly without any lags.
