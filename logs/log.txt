The boss has tasked us with designing the software for a fun snake game in Python. The code for the game should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a fun, engaging snake game",
    "Ensure the game is easy to understand and play",
    "Design the game to be visually appealing"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily understand the game rules so I can start playing quickly",
    "As a user, I want the game to be challenging so I can improve my skills",
    "As a user, I want to be able to see my high score so I can track my progress",
    "As a user, I want the game to be visually appealing so I can enjoy playing it",
    "As a user, I want the game to run smoothly without any glitches"

2023-08-28 22:35:21.266 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
We will use the Pygame library, which is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in Python. Pygame is highly portable and runs on almost every platform and operating system.
The game logic will be implemented in a Game class, which will handle the game loop, user input, and game state. The Snake and Food classes will be used to represent the snake and the food respectively. The ScoreBoard class will be used to track and display the current and high scores.

## Python package name
```python
"snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "scoreboard.py"
]
```

```mermaid

        +Snake snake
        +Food food
        +ScoreBoard scoreboard

    }
    class ScoreBoard{
