The boss has tasked us with designing the software for a fun snake game in Python. The code for the game should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a simple yet engaging snake game in Python",

]
```

## User Stories
```python

    "As a user, I want the game to get progressively harder so I am always challenged",
    "As a user, I want to be able to pause and resume the game so I can take breaks",

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a simple and engaging snake game designed in Python. It should be easy to understand and play, and visually appealing. The game should get progressively harder and allow users to pause and resume. It should also display the user's high score.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[

## UI Design draft
The game should have a simple and clean interface. The main screen should display the game area, score, and controls. The game area should be a grid where the snake moves around. The score should be displayed at the top of the screen. The controls should be intuitive and easy to use, such as arrow keys for movement.

2023-08-30 22:47:24.529 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
The snake game will be implemented using Python's built-in modules and the open-source Pygame library for the game's graphical interface. The game will be designed in an object-oriented manner with classes for the main game, the snake, and the food. The game will progressively get harder by increasing the speed of the snake as the score increases. The game state (paused or running) will be managed using a simple boolean flag. The high score will be stored in a file and loaded each time the game starts.

The game will be designed in an object-oriented manner with classes for the main game, the snake, and the food. The game will progressively get harder by increasing the speed of the snake as the score increases. The game state (paused or running) will be managed using a simple boolean flag. The high score will be stored in a file and loaded each time the game starts.", 'Python package name': '"python_snake_game"\n', 'File list': ['main.py', 'game.py', 'snake.py', 'food.py', 'score_manager.py'], 'Data structures and interface definitions': 'classDiagram\n    class Main{\n        +void run()\n    }\n    class Game{\n        +bool is_running\n        +int score\n        +void start_game()\n        +void pause_game()\n        +void resume_game()\n        +void end_game()\n    }\n    class Snake{\n        +list body\n        +str direction\n        +void move()\n        +void grow()\n    }\n    class Food{\n        +tuple position\n        +void generate()\n    }\n    class ScoreManager{\n        +int high_score\n        +void load_high_score()\n        +void save_high_score()\n    }\n    Main -- Game: initiates\n    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls\n    Game "1" -- "1" Food: controls\n    Game "1" -- "1" ScoreManager: uses\n', 'Program call flow': 'sequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    participant SM as ScoreManager\n    M->>G: start_game()\n    G->>SM: load_high_score()\n    loop Game Loop\n        G->>S: move()\n        alt Collision with Food\n            G->>F: generate()\n            G->>S: grow()\n            G->>G: increase score\n        end\n        alt Collision with Self or Border\n            G->>G: end_game()\n        end\n        alt Pause Command\n            G->>G: pause_game()\n            opt Resume Command\n                G->>G: resume_game()\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    G->>SM: save_high_score()\n    G->>M: end game\n', 'Anything UNCLEAR': 'The requirement is clear to me.'}
