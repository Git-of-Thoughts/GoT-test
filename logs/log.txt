Design the software of a Tetris game in Python.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a simple and engaging Tetris game using Python",
    "Ensure the game is easy to navigate and user-friendly",
    "Ensure the game is efficient and runs smoothly without any lags"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to start a new game easily so that I can play whenever I want",
    "As a user, I want to be able to pause and resume the game so that I can take breaks",
    "As a user, I want the game to keep track of my high scores so that I can see my progress",
    "As a user, I want the game to run smoothly without any lags so that I can have a seamless gaming experience",
    "As a user, I want the game to have a simple and intuitive interface so that I can navigate easily"

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a Tetris game developed in Python. The game should have a simple and user-friendly interface. It should include features like starting a new game, pausing and resuming the game, and tracking high scores. The game should run smoothly without any lags.

## Requirement Pool
```python

```

## UI Design draft
The game interface should be simple and intuitive. It should have a main menu with options to start a new game, view high scores, and exit the game. The game screen should display the current score, the next piece, and the game grid. The game should have simple and clean graphics with a retro feel.

2023-09-12 03:32:19.546 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
We will use the Pygame library, which is an open-source module for Python designed for video game creation. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries. The difficult points of the requirements are the game mechanics of Tetris and the implementation of a feature to track high scores. We will need to design the game in such a way that it efficiently handles the falling blocks and the completed lines. For the high score feature, we will need to implement a way to store and retrieve the highest scores.
