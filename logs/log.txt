2023-08-24 23:09:30.189 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Original Requirements
The task is to design a complex shopping platform software similar to Amazon. The software should be written by an engineer.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a user-friendly shopping platform",
    "Ensure the platform is scalable and can handle a large number of products and users",
    "Implement robust security measures to protect user data"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to easily search for products so that I can find what I'm looking for quickly",
    "As a user, I want to be able to securely save my payment information so that I can checkout faster",
    "As a user, I want to see product reviews from other users so that I can make informed purchasing decisions",
    "As a user, I want to be able to track my orders so that I know when they will arrive",
    "As a vendor, I want to be able to manage my product listings so that I can keep my inventory up to date"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Amazon: The largest online retailer, offers a wide range of products and services, strong brand recognition, but often criticized for poor vendor relations",
    "eBay: Known for its auction-style sales, allows individuals to sell used items, but the interface is not as user-friendly",
    "Alibaba: Largest online retailer in Asia, offers bulk purchasing options, but has faced criticism for counterfeit products",
    "Walmart Online: Has a large physical retail presence, offers in-store pickup, but the online interface can be clunky",
    "Etsy: Focuses on handmade and vintage items, strong community aspect, but not suitable for all product types"
]
```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a shopping platform that is user-friendly, scalable, and secure. It should allow users to search for products, view product reviews, save payment information, and track orders. Vendors should be able to manage their product listings.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement a search function for products", "P0"),
    ("Create a secure system for saving user payment information", "P0"),
    ("Develop a system for users to leave and view product reviews", "P1"),
    ("Implement order tracking for users", "P1"),
    ("Create a system for vendors to manage product listings", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The platform should have a clean, minimalist design with easy-to-read fonts and intuitive navigation. The homepage should feature a search bar at the top, with popular products and categories displayed below. Each product page should include product details, reviews, and a 'Add to Cart' button. The user's cart and order history should be easily accessible from any page.

2023-08-24 23:10:12.804 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
To implement the shopping platform, we will use the Django framework due to its scalability and robustness. Django's ORM will help us handle database operations efficiently. We will use PostgreSQL as our database due to its performance and scalability. For search functionality, we will use Elasticsearch, which provides powerful full-text search capabilities. For payment information, we will use Stripe API for secure payment processing. For user authentication and security, we will use Django's built-in authentication system. We will also use Docker for containerization which will help us ensure that the application runs the same way in every environment.
